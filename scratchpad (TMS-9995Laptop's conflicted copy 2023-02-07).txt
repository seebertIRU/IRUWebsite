I'm Ted from Oregon, and I just read Inclusivity and Love article by Bishop Barron, 
and I have what I feel is the central question of the synod.
Do we have a hospital church that embraces the cross to provide reconcilliation 
between God and man, sinner and victim;
or are we building a hospice church that provides only absolution to the sinner?  


Do we have a hospital church or a hospice church?
This is the central question of the current synod.
The hospital church doesn't just grant remission of sins, but goes on to help bring reconciliation between God and humans, between sinner and victim. 
 The true cross needs both vertical and horizontal healing.
The hospice church just accompanies the sick soul into hell; abandoning the horizontal victims and in complete ignorance of the 
ideal presented by the deposit of faith (or sometimes, anything that happened in church history prior to 1963).
