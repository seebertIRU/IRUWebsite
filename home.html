    <p>Ted Seeber, the CEO of Information R-Us is an IT Consultant, a Project Manager and Fractional CTO offering services such as online technical support, small business tax services, onsite computer installations. Ted also offers software engineering, computer repair and virus removal to small business owners on a W2 basis.  Rates are negotiable between $60-$150/hr, depending on skills needed, or full time at $145,000/year</p>
    <table>
	  <tr> <td>Project Management</td><td>Information R-US offers Full Software Development Lifecycle Engineering including an all-inclusive framework that guides the entire process of creating high-quality software from its preliminary concept to its deployment and long-term maintenance. Ted, the CEO of Information R-Us will work with you to gather requirements, subcontract coders, create design documents, execute validation and testing, and finally put together an implementation plan. He will work to gain resources necessary for onsite or web hosting, set up source code control: a bug tracking ticketing system, and work with you to utilize Continuous Implementation/Continuous Development Scripts. Ted can completely manage your project and set up an Agile team.</td></tr>
	  <tr> <td>Full Stack Software Engineering</td><td>From the initial requirements gathering until your product is perfect, Ted does software engineering including modern Zencoder coding in a variety of languages.  He can even take over projects left unfinished by other consultants. </td></tr>
	  <tr> <td>Data Analysis/Data Scientist</td><td>Got a mess of data that you don't know what to do with?  Are all of your direct reports taking CSV extracts into Excel and giving you conflicting analysis?  This is the specialty of Information-R-Us, let Ted help you get to a single source of truth!</td></tr>
	  <tr> <td>Data Engineering</td><td>Power BI is no longer just “one of the tools” — it’s become the core of business analytics. Power BI has many benefits that can be used to accelerate business decision-making to improve efficiency and accuracy. It eliminates labor-intensive processes from multiple sources such as spreadsheets and cloud services, delivers instantaneous insights with up-to-date, live dashboards and reports, and enables faster and more profound analytics with interactive visual aids to interpret complex data. It also self-governates analytics to provide non-technical staff with drag-and-drop dashboards and AI-powered insights, in addition to utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver predictive insights and detect glitches. Every industry, from finance to healthcare, relies on real-time dashboards and reports to make billion-dollar decisions. The surprising truth? Companies that use BI tools like Power BI are 5x faster at decision-making. Ted provides advanced business consulting on Power BI and other tools. Do you need cloud services? Or perhaps you realize "cloud" just means "other people's computers" and you don't trust the cloud with your data? Is your small business growing and you need more than just what a couple of computers can provide? Are you hiring quickly and need a standardized laptop build? Ted can set up, manage, and maintain your dedicated physical or virtual server and all of your employee workstations with vital IT services such as file sharing, data backups, secure remote access, and application hosting. He utilizes a wide range of hardware such as tower servers or rack servers, and software like Windows Server Essentials. Ted can design, advise, and set up your small business backroom servers for you and his cost is negotiable.</td></tr>
	  <tr> <td>GenAI Automation</td><td>Are you ready for the next step in automation of your business processes?  Let Information-R-Us Gather Requirements, set you up with cloud based or onsite AI services, and let the AI do your tasks for you.</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Close this business</td><td>Need any of the above services 40 hours a week for at least a year?  For a mere $165,000 salary with benefits, you can hire Ted and cause this business to close for as long as you like.  Minimum 1 year contract.</td></tr>
