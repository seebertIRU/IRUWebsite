			<h2>Help Nick Smith graduate.</h2>
			<p>Nick is a young man with autism.  He's less than a year away from his high school graduation- 
			just needs 3 more credits in summer school and next fall.  As he will graduate in the fall, his 
			school is willing to let him walk with his age peers for graduation on June 2nd.  But the Mollala 
			River School Board won't let students without enough credits have a real graduation.  I'm asking
			you to send an e-mail in support of Nick to the Mollala River School Distric School Board.</p>

Help Nick Smith Graduate!
Nick Smith is a student at Renaisance Charter High School.  He is autistic and struggles with socialization.  
He is only three credits away from graduating with his age group peers.  Despite the recent policy change,
his school is willing to let him walk for graduation with his age peers.  He will likely earn the remaining
three credits next fall, and receive his diploma long before the next graduation ceremony would take place.
I am therefore asking you to please let Nick Smith walk with his graduating class.</textarea>
