You are confirmed for a phone screen with Shiftwise Monday 2/2 at 2:00pm. I have
attached Shiftwise core values for you to look over along with the following.

Hello, and thanks for your interest in ShiftWise!

Job interviews can be stressful. We want your experience with ShiftWise to be
positive, so we’ve compiled this guide to help you prepare. This gives everyone
the best opportunity to see if ShiftWise is a good match for your skills,
experience, work preferences, goals, and personality.

Every candidate we hire goes through at least two separate interviews: A
technical phone screen and an in-person interview. The sections that follow
explain these interviews. They tell you what you can expect and provide tips on
how best to prepare.

The attachment is a list of traits that we value. It should help to give you an
idea of what’s important to us and what we’re looking for in potential new
coworkers.

The Technical Phone Screen

Every candidate starts out with a technical phone screen. A member of our team
will call you at a prearranged date and time and ask you a series of questions
about the technologies we use.

The purpose of this interview is to assess your technical skills and experience
in a variety of areas. The subject areas covered will depend on the job, but
will correspond to the desired skills listed in the job description. Be sure to
ask your recruiter if you have any questions.

All technical screens use a predetermined list of questions, but we will also
ask follow-up questions based on your responses. This adaptive interviewing
technique helps us assess the depth and breadth of your knowledge, but it also
helps you by giving you a chance to really shine in areas where you’re
particularly strong.

These interviews take anywhere from fifteen to forty-five minutes to complete
depending on the role, the level of experience desired, and the answers
provided. At the end of the interview, we provide you an opportunity to ask us
questions about ShiftWise, our teams, the role you’re applying for, and the way
we work.

Tips:

·         Be sure to confirm the day and time with your recruiter in advance.

·         Be ready! Make sure your phone is charged, has a good signal, and find
a quiet area where you won’t be interrupted or distracted.

·         The best course of study for the technical phone screen is your
experience and/or education up to this point.  Refresh your knowledge as you
feel necessary, but don’t over-prepare.

·         Don’t use search engines to look up answers during the interview.  It
doesn’t help—and trust me, we can tell!

·         Be factual and objective in your responses. Don’t try to give us “the
answer we want”. Tell us what you know and what you think.

·         If you don’t know an answer, be willing to venture a reasonable guess.
That gives us a chance to discuss and reason through the topic . If someone
responds with a flat “I don’t know”, there’s nowhere we can go from there.

·         Don’t worry if you get some questions “wrong”: Everyone does!  We’ve
never turned away a candidate just because they didn’t know one specific fact

·         Come prepared with questions for us!

Please give me a call after the interview. 503.688.1918

Good Luck,

Eric Lovely

                                          ShiftWise Core Values
              The list of traits below summarize our Core Values here at ShiftWise. They
              convey what matters to us, what we admire and respect in others. Viewed as a
              whole, they describe the kind of people we want to hire, the people we enjoy
              working with.
              Note that these are things we value. It’s not meant to imply that every one of
              us possesses all ten in abundance. We all have room to grow.
              Also, the terms aren’t listed in any particular order. They’re not organized by
              importance or rank.

      Flexibility: We want to work with other people who are flexible. They’re willing to take on a many
                   different kinds of tasks. They aren’t put off by occasional changes in priority, direction, or
                   process. They don’t need everyone to work or communicate the exact same way they do.
    Persistence: We want to work with other people who are self-motivated to carry their work through to
                 completion. They don’t abandon tasks. They don’t let small issues stop them. They find
                 ways to work around or through issues without compromising goals. They also know when
                 to quit, when to consider alternatives, when to seek help.
       Integrity: We want to work with other people who are trustworthy. Given a task, we can leave them
                  to their work. We don’t have to check up on them to make sure they aren’t circumventing
                  our established practices and methods or lying about where they’re spending their time.
      Discipline: We want to work with other people who are disciplined. They apply a great deal of care to
                  their work in all its details. They don’t shirk valuable practices just because they seem
                  uninteresting or inconvenient. They understand the powerful and positive overall effect of
                  applying diligence in many small things.
       Empathy: We want to work with other people who honestly and openly seek to understand the values
                and viewpoints of others. They aren’t entirely self-serving. They know that their decisions
                impact a wider audience and act accordingly. They’re better able to navigate conflict &
                negotiate solutions because they put themselves in others’ shoes.
Self-Awareness: We want to work with people who know themselves well, who know their own strengths
                and weaknesses. They aren’t over-confident, but neither are they obsequious. They know
                what they need in order to succeed.
Being Proactive: We want to work with other people who have initiative. They promote their ideas and can
                 defend them with facts and reason. They seek out opportunities to make continuous
                 improvements. It’s important to note, though, that being proactive doesn’t mean they try to
                 do everything themselves.
 Self-Improving: The people we want to work with want to grow. They don’t just want to be great at what
                 they do, they want to be better: better than they were last month, last week, or just better
                 than they were yesterday. They value and practice continuous self-education. They’re
                 honest and open about the mistakes they’ve made and use them as opportunities to
                 improve themselves and benefit others.
Communication: We want to work with other people who are effective communicators. This doesn’t just
               mean that they write clear emails or can speak in public (though those are valuable skills). It
               means that they can read and respect individual communication styles and preferences.
               They’re aware of their audience and adjust their message appropriately. They don’t hoard
               information, but neither do they broadcast their every thought or idea.
         Talent: We want to work with people who excel at what they do. Those with long experience will
                 have built up a broad, deep arsenal of skills. Those lacking experience more than make up
                 for it by their intuition and raw ability

Congratulations on securing an onsite interview with Cascade Corporation, Friday
the 19^th at 4:30pm

Please give my account manager, Sara Boraston, a call when you are getting close
as GPS doesn’t take you all the way there.

Her number is 831-247-4448

Location: 2201 NE 201st Ave, Fairview, OR 97204

Be sure to research the company’s website at https://www.cascorp.com/. Please
bring something to write with and be professionally dressed, also, be sure to
speak loudly, clearly, confidently, and concisely. Show your personality do your
best to build rapport. It’s important to remember that 90% of interviews are
based on personality, so be yourself! Let your confidence shine through and
above all, be upbeat about the opportunity. Skills can be taught, personality
cannot!

Please also be sure to answer all of the managers questions, but also make sure
you have all of your questions answered as well. Lastly, be sure to thank the
manager for their time. I know much of this is common etiquette, but you’d be
surprised how many people we work with that forget the small things, so I tend
to over-communicate J

Good luck and give me a call at the office after the interview.  I look forward
to hearing how it went!

Best of luck - we thank you in advance for representing us well and look forward
                           to hearing from you soon.

Thanks for catching that, we also got the notification that you had already been
submitted to 8616, but 8597 has already been closed since a couple of days back.

I would strongly encourage you to focus on 8537 simply because the staff in this
group recognized your name and are looking to set up an interview shortly. The
Docusign included all the similar roles as a safety plan to be able to submit
you to other similar roles if they matched your skillset and 8537 did not go
through, but it looks like the hiring manager really liked your experience for
this role and will be letting us know a time to contact you shortly. I will
notify you as soon as that information comes to my email. Thanks for your
patience Ted and hope you have a great day!

When I was talking to Pedro yesterday about two other Intel
roles, it looks like I got a bit confused on the roles I was
bing submitted for.  Adidi had already submitted me for these
two.  I did not realize netpolarity was putting me up for four
separate roles.  I only figured it out because I had a bit of
a data loss on my job spreadsheet, and I had to reconstruct
from the signed Docuscans.

    bing submitted for.  Adidi had already submitted me for these
    two.  I did not realize netpolarity was putting me up for four
    separate roles.  I only figured it out because I had a bit of
    a data loss on my job spreadsheet, and I had to reconstruct
    from the signed Docuscans.

    Hi Theodore,

    Good to hear from you. You have already been submitted to 8537 and your
    resume has been sent to the hiring manager. Our contact at Intel remembers
    working with you; and she is trying to get the manager to set up an
    interview.

    Please do not re-submit by another agency; and hopefully we have an
    interview request for you soon.

      Hi Ted,

      Thanks for catching that, we also got the notification that you had
      already been submitted to 8616, but 8597 has already been closed since a
      couple of days back.

      I would strongly encourage you to focus on 8537 simply because the staff
      in this group recognized your name and are looking to set up an interview
      shortly. The Docusign included all the similar roles as a safety plan to
      be able to submit you to other similar roles if they matched your skillset
      and 8537 did not go through, but it looks like the hiring manager really
      liked your experience for this role and will be letting us know a time to
      contact you shortly. I will notify you as soon as that information comes
      to my email. Thanks for your patience Ted and hope you have a great day!

I am sorry to hear you had a difficult time getting your resume submitted  to
this role. Here at NetPolarity we actually take care of the key words being on
your summary portion of the resume. Although, there is an uncertainty with this
particular role. Because it is with the same group as REQ # 8338 it may conflict
if you have been submitted to this group. We will double check to make sure so
you are not disqualified. In the meantime, go ahead and send us the RTR for 8478
so we have it ready in case it does not conflict and we are allowed to send you
in.

8478 looks like one that I failed to be submitted on due to ""lack of keywords on
resume"".  I finally got fed up with the people attempting to submit me, so I
withdrew.  If you would like to take a chance, I've added the keywords in the
additional notes to this resume, I think it might pass the automated gatekeeper
this time.  I'm putting down Netpolarity as my submitter for this role.

      Hi Theodore,

      Good to hear from you. You have already been submitted to 8537 and your
      resume has been sent to the hiring manager. Our contact at Intel remembers
      working with you; and she is trying to get the manager to set up an

      Please do not re-submit by another agency; and hopefully we have an

      I just got a call from a recruiter for 8537.  It is apparently still
      open.  By my records, I am now eligible to return to Intel.  Any word from
      Tony Studenroth's CPTD group?

        Hi Ted,

        Thanks for catching that, we also got the notification that you had
        already been submitted to 8616, but 8597 has already been closed since a
        couple of days back.

        I would strongly encourage you to focus on 8537 simply because the staff
        in this group recognized your name and are looking to set up an
        interview shortly. The Docusign included all the similar roles as a
        safety plan to be able to submit you to other similar roles if they
        matched your skillset and 8537 did not go through, but it looks like the
        hiring manager really liked your experience for this role and will be
        letting us know a time to contact you shortly. I will notify you as soon

        Possible double submittal:

        Inte #ITEKJP00008616/8597

        When I was talking to Pedro yesterday about two other Intel
        roles, it looks like I got a bit confused on the roles I was
        bing submitted for.  Adidi had already submitted me for these
        two.  I did not realize netpolarity was putting me up for four
        separate roles.  I only figured it out because I had a bit of
        a data loss on my job spreadsheet, and I had to reconstruct
        from the signed Docuscans.

  I am sorry to hear you had a difficult time getting your resume submitted  to

  your summary portion of the resume. Although, there is an uncertainty with
  this particular role. Because it is with the same group as REQ # 8338 it may
  conflict if you have been submitted to this group. We will double check to
  make sure so you are not disqualified. In the meantime, go ahead and send us

  8478 looks like one that I failed to be submitted on due to ""lack of keywords
  on resume"".  I finally got fed up with the people attempting to submit me, so
  I withdrew.  If you would like to take a chance, I've added the keywords in
  the additional notes to this resume, I think it might pass the automated
  gatekeeper this time.  I'm putting down Netpolarity as my submitter for this
  role.

          Possible double submittal:

          Inte #ITEKJP00008616/8597

          When I was talking to Pedro yesterday about two other Intel
          roles, it looks like I got a bit confused on the roles I was
          bing submitted for.  Adidi had already submitted me for these
          two.  I did not realize netpolarity was putting me up for four
          separate roles.  I only figured it out because I had a bit of
          a data loss on my job spreadsheet, and I had to reconstruct
          from the signed Docuscans.

  Hi Theodore,

  Just wanted to let you know that I have received your right to represent form.
  Before we submit you for the role, I wanted to double check that you have
  Visual Studio experience because it is not listed on your resume and just
  wanted to see what version you have experience with. They are looking for
  experience in the 2012 version or newer. Please let me know and if you can add
  it to your resume or I can add it if you tell me what project you worked on
  and with which company.

  Thanks a lot Theodore and thank you for your patience with this process.

    I am sorry to hear you had a difficult time getting your resume submitted

    uncertainty with this particular role. Because it is with the same group as

    double check to make sure so you are not disqualified. In the meantime, go

    8478 looks like one that I failed to be submitted on due to ""lack of
    keywords on resume"".  I finally got fed up with the people attempting to
    submit me, so I withdrew.  If you would like to take a chance, I've added
    the keywords in the additional notes to this resume, I think it might pass
    the automated gatekeeper this time.  I'm putting down Netpolarity as my
    submitter for this role.

          I just got a call from a recruiter for 8537.  It is apparently still
          open.  By my records, I am now eligible to return to Intel.  Any word
          from Tony Studenroth's CPTD group?

            Thanks for catching that, we also got the notification that you had
            already been submitted to 8616, but 8597 has already been closed
            since a couple of days back.

            I would strongly encourage you to focus on 8537 simply because the
            staff in this group recognized your name and are looking to set up
            an interview shortly. The Docusign included all the similar roles as
            a safety plan to be able to submit you to other similar roles if
            they matched your skillset and 8537 did not go through, but it looks
            like the hiring manager really liked your experience for this role
            and will be letting us know a time to contact you shortly. I will
            notify you as soon as that information comes to my email. Thanks for

            roles, it looks like I got a bit confused on the roles I was
            bing submitted for.  Adidi had already submitted me for these
            two.  I did not realize netpolarity was putting me up for four
            separate roles.  I only figured it out because I had a bit of
            a data loss on my job spreadsheet, and I had to reconstruct
            from the signed Docuscans.

    Hi Theodore,

    Just wanted to let you know that I have received your right to represent
    form. Before we submit you for the role, I wanted to double check that you
    have Visual Studio experience because it is not listed on your resume and
    just wanted to see what version you have experience with. They are looking
    for experience in the 2012 version or newer. Please let me know and if you
    can add it to your resume or I can add it if you tell me what project you
    worked on and with which company.

    Thanks a lot Theodore and thank you for your patience with this process.

      Hello Theodore,

      I am sorry to hear you had a difficult time getting your resume submitted
      to this role. Here at NetPolarity we actually take care of the key words
      being on your summary portion of the resume. Although, there is an
      uncertainty with this particular role. Because it is with the same group
      as REQ # 8338 it may conflict if you have been submitted to this group. We
      will double check to make sure so you are not disqualified. In the
      meantime, go ahead and send us the RTR for 8478 so we have it ready in
      case it does not conflict and we are allowed to send you in.

      8478 looks like one that I failed to be submitted on due to ""lack of
      keywords on resume"".  I finally got fed up with the people attempting to
      submit me, so I withdrew.  If you would like to take a chance, I've added
      the keywords in the additional notes to this resume, I think it might pass
      the automated gatekeeper this time.  I'm putting down Netpolarity as my
      submitter for this role.

            your resume has been sent to the hiring manager. Our contact at
            Intel remembers working with you; and she is trying to get the

            Please do not re-submit by another agency; and hopefully we have an

              Thanks for catching that, we also got the notification that you
              had already been submitted to 8616, but 8597 has already been
              closed since a couple of days back.

              I would strongly encourage you to focus on 8537 simply because the
              staff in this group recognized your name and are looking to set up
              an interview shortly. The Docusign included all the similar roles
              as a safety plan to be able to submit you to other similar roles
              if they matched your skillset and 8537 did not go through, but it
              looks like the hiring manager really liked your experience for
              this role and will be letting us know a time to contact you
              shortly. I will notify you as soon as that information comes to my

              When I was talking to Pedro yesterday about two other Intel
              roles, it looks like I got a bit confused on the roles I was
              bing submitted for.  Adidi had already submitted me for these
              two.  I did not realize netpolarity was putting me up for four
              separate roles.  I only figured it out because I had a bit of
              a data loss on my job spreadsheet, and I had to reconstruct
              from the signed Docuscans.

  I knew that- after I asked in the interview.  That's why I called you back as
  soon as I got off the phone with Apex.

  I always ask about next steps in my interview.

  It's also the right decision for my career.  That other project- I could do
  it.  It's the same type of Web App coding I have been doing since 2003.  But
  this- this is a chance to do some white hat hacking and also design a full
  replacement second sourced database and import system.

Dear Sir/Ma’am:

       Selective Service System’s Region III Headquarters in Denver, Colorado has your
internet Local Board Member Inquiry information and I thank you for your interest. Our Board
Members are Selective Service System uncompensated employees who stand ready to render
decisions on cases of young men seeking deferment, exemption or postponement of military
service under any future return to conscription. They are appointed by the President upon
nomination from a State’s or Territory’s Governor.

       By law, Board Members may serve for a maximum of twenty years. Vacancies occur
when a Board Member completes twenty years of service, relocates, becomes unable or
unwilling to fulfill the position’s requirements, or voluntarily resigns. Consequently, vacancies
are unpredictable and may not occur for many years. If you desire consideration for a possible
Board Member vacancy, please complete the accompanying Selective Service System Form
404 and return it to us. We will maintain your information in our “Potential Board Member”
database and a Selective Service Reserve Officer will contact you when a vacancy becomes
available.

      Residents of Arizona and Kansas will also have to include a biography.

      We appreciate your interest in serving your country with the Selective Service System.

                                                       Sincerely,

                                                       John J. Wilber

Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                         SSS Board Member Application

                                                    Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520

   The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President.
However, there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who
would be willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as
SSS Board Members.

A. Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

          1. You MUST:
                   a. be a citizen of the United States;
                   b. be at least 18 years of age;
                   c. reside in the county/borough/parish in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                   d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                   e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                   f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.
          2. You MAY NOT:
                   a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                   b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                   c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                   d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                   e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                               i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                               ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                               iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                   f. have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under charges for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                   fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) you have since
                   displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

B. Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
   Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of 5 members and membership of
   each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the Registrants within its
   jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

C. Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine whether the basic eligibility requirements are
   met. Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling
   out the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of
   Pay and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

D. Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately 5 hours of initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
   training consisting of 2 hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board Members
   are unable to attend 3 consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their position.

E. Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meetings as a
   Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption or postponement of induction.
   Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
   sessions and Board meetings.

F. Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
   conducting SSS duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit. Board
   Members do receive satisfaction knowing that they have had vital role in insuring that our nation’s defense manpower needs have been met in a just and
   impartial manner.

G. Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
   form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
   abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

Dear Sir/Ma’am:

       Selective Service System’s Region III Headquarters in Denver, Colorado has your
internet Local Board Member Inquiry information and I thank you for your interest. Our Board
Members are Selective Service System uncompensated employees who stand ready to render
decisions on cases of young men seeking deferment, exemption or postponement of military
service under any future return to conscription. They are appointed by the President upon
nomination from a State’s or Territory’s Governor.

       By law, Board Members may serve for a maximum of twenty years. Vacancies occur
when a Board Member completes twenty years of service, relocates, becomes unable or
unwilling to fulfill the position’s requirements, or voluntarily resigns. Consequently, vacancies
are unpredictable and may not occur for many years. If you desire consideration for a possible
Board Member vacancy, please complete the accompanying Selective Service System Form
404 and return it to us. We will maintain your information in our “Potential Board Member”
database and a Selective Service Reserve Officer will contact you when a vacancy becomes
available.

      Residents of Arizona and Kansas will also have to include a biography.

      We appreciate your interest in serving your country with the Selective Service System.

                                                       Sincerely,

                                                       John J. Wilber

        Delivery Processes

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Agency
        Support Processes
Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                         SSS Board Member Application

                                                    Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520

   The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President.
However, there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who
would be willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as
SSS Board Members.

A. Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

          1. You MUST:
                   a. be a citizen of the United States;
                   b. be at least 18 years of age;
                   c. reside in the county/borough/parish in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                   d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                   e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                   f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.
          2. You MAY NOT:
                   a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                   b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                   c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                   d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                   e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                               i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                               ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                               iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                   f. have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under charges for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                   fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) you have since
                   displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

B. Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
   Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of 5 members and membership of
   each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the Registrants within its
   jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

C. Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine whether the basic eligibility requirements are
   met. Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling
   out the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of
   Pay and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

D. Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately 5 hours of initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
   training consisting of 2 hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board Members
   are unable to attend 3 consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their position.

E. Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meetings as a
   Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption or postponement of induction.
   Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
   sessions and Board meetings.

F. Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
   conducting SSS duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit. Board
   Members do receive satisfaction knowing that they have had vital role in insuring that our nation’s defense manpower needs have been met in a just and
   impartial manner.

G. Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached

Dear Sir/Ma’am:

       Selective Service System’s Region III Headquarters in Denver, Colorado has your
internet Local Board Member Inquiry information and I thank you for your interest. Our Board
Members are Selective Service System uncompensated employees who stand ready to render
decisions on cases of young men seeking deferment, exemption or postponement of military
service under any future return to conscription. They are appointed by the President upon
nomination from a State’s or Territory’s Governor.

       By law, Board Members may serve for a maximum of twenty years. Vacancies occur
when a Board Member completes twenty years of service, relocates, becomes unable or
unwilling to fulfill the position’s requirements, or voluntarily resigns. Consequently, vacancies
are unpredictable and may not occur for many years. If you desire consideration for a possible
Board Member vacancy, please complete the accompanying Selective Service System Form
404 and return it to us. We will maintain your information in our “Potential Board Member”
database and a Selective Service Reserve Officer will contact you when a vacancy becomes
available.

      Residents of Arizona and Kansas will also have to include a biography.

      We appreciate your interest in serving your country with the Selective Service System.

                                                       Sincerely,

                                                       John J. Wilber
                                                       Region Director

Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                         SSS Board Member Application

                                                    Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520

   The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President.
However, there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who
would be willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as
SSS Board Members.

A. Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

          1. You MUST:
                   a. be a citizen of the United States;
                   b. be at least 18 years of age;
                   c. reside in the county/borough/parish in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                   d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                   e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                   f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.
          2. You MAY NOT:
                   a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                   b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                   c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                   d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                   e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                               i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                               ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                               iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                   f. have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under charges for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                   fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) you have since
                   displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

B. Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
   Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of 5 members and membership of
   each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the Registrants within its
   jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

C. Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine whether the basic eligibility requirements are
   met. Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling
   out the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of
   Pay and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

D. Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately 5 hours of initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
   training consisting of 2 hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board Members
   are unable to attend 3 consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their position.

E. Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meetings as a
   Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption or postponement of induction.
   Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
   sessions and Board meetings.

F. Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
   conducting SSS duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit. Board
   Members do receive satisfaction knowing that they have had vital role in insuring that our nation’s defense manpower needs have been met in a just and
   impartial manner.

G. Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
   form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
   abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

Dear Sir/Ma’am:

       Selective Service System’s Region III Headquarters in Denver, Colorado has your
internet Local Board Member Inquiry information and I thank you for your interest. Our Board
Members are Selective Service System uncompensated employees who stand ready to render
decisions on cases of young men seeking deferment, exemption or postponement of military
service under any future return to conscription. They are appointed by the President upon
nomination from a State’s or Territory’s Governor.

       By law, Board Members may serve for a maximum of twenty years. Vacancies occur
when a Board Member completes twenty years of service, relocates, becomes unable or
unwilling to fulfill the position’s requirements, or voluntarily resigns. Consequently, vacancies
are unpredictable and may not occur for many years. If you desire consideration for a possible
Board Member vacancy, please complete the accompanying Selective Service System Form
404 and return it to us. We will maintain your information in our “Potential Board Member”
database and a Selective Service Reserve Officer will contact you when a vacancy becomes
available.

      Residents of Arizona and Kansas will also have to include a biography.

      We appreciate your interest in serving your country with the Selective Service System.

                                                       Sincerely,

                                                       John J. Wilber
                                                       Region Director

        Delivery Processes

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Agency
        Support Processes
Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                    Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520

   The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President.
However, there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who
would be willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as
SSS Board Members.

A. Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

          1. You MUST:
                   a. be a citizen of the United States;
                   b. be at least 18 years of age;
                   c. reside in the county/borough/parish in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                   d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                   e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                   f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.
          2. You MAY NOT:
                   a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                   b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                   c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                   d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                   e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                               i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                               ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                               iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                   f. have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under charges for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                   fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) you have since
                   displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

B. Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
   Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of 5 members and membership of
   each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the Registrants within its
   jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

C. Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine whether the basic eligibility requirements are
   met. Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling
   out the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of
   Pay and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

D. Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately 5 hours of initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
   training consisting of 2 hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board Members
   are unable to attend 3 consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their position.

E. Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meetings as a
   Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption or postponement of induction.
   Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
   sessions and Board meetings.

F. Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
   conducting SSS duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit. Board
   Members do receive satisfaction knowing that they have had vital role in insuring that our nation’s defense manpower needs have been met in a just and
   impartial manner.

G. Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
   form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
   abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

Dear Sir/Ma’am:

       Selective Service System’s Region III Headquarters in Denver, Colorado has your
internet Local Board Member Inquiry information and I thank you for your interest. Our Board
Members are Selective Service System uncompensated employees who stand ready to render
decisions on cases of young men seeking deferment, exemption or postponement of military
service under any future return to conscription. They are appointed by the President upon
nomination from a State’s or Territory’s Governor.

       By law, Board Members may serve for a maximum of twenty years. Vacancies occur
when a Board Member completes twenty years of service, relocates, becomes unable or
unwilling to fulfill the position’s requirements, or voluntarily resigns. Consequently, vacancies
are unpredictable and may not occur for many years. If you desire consideration for a possible
Board Member vacancy, please complete the accompanying Selective Service System Form
404 and return it to us. We will maintain your information in our “Potential Board Member”
database and a Selective Service Reserve Officer will contact you when a vacancy becomes
available.

      Residents of Arizona and Kansas will also have to include a biography.

      We appreciate your interest in serving your country with the Selective Service System.

                                                       Sincerely,

                                                       John J. Wilber

Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                         SSS Board Member Application

                                                    Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520

   The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President.
However, there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who
would be willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as
SSS Board Members.

A. Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

          1. You MUST:
                   a. be a citizen of the United States;
                   b. be at least 18 years of age;
                   c. reside in the county/borough/parish in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                   d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                   e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                   f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.
          2. You MAY NOT:
                   a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                   b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                   c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                   d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                   e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                               i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                               ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                               iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                   f. have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under charges for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                   fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) you have since
                   displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

B. Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
   Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of 5 members and membership of
   each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the Registrants within its
   jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

C. Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine whether the basic eligibility requirements are
   met. Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling
   out the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of
   Pay and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

D. Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately 5 hours of initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
   training consisting of 2 hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board Members
   are unable to attend 3 consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their position.

E. Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meetings as a
   Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption or postponement of induction.
   Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
   sessions and Board meetings.

F. Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
   conducting SSS duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit. Board
   Members do receive satisfaction knowing that they have had vital role in insuring that our nation’s defense manpower needs have been met in a just and
   impartial manner.

G. Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
   form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
   abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

Dear Sir/Ma’am:

       Selective Service System’s Region III Headquarters in Denver, Colorado has your
internet Local Board Member Inquiry information and I thank you for your interest. Our Board
Members are Selective Service System uncompensated employees who stand ready to render
decisions on cases of young men seeking deferment, exemption or postponement of military
service under any future return to conscription. They are appointed by the President upon
nomination from a State’s or Territory’s Governor.

       By law, Board Members may serve for a maximum of twenty years. Vacancies occur
when a Board Member completes twenty years of service, relocates, becomes unable or
unwilling to fulfill the position’s requirements, or voluntarily resigns. Consequently, vacancies
are unpredictable and may not occur for many years. If you desire consideration for a possible
Board Member vacancy, please complete the accompanying Selective Service System Form
404 and return it to us. We will maintain your information in our “Potential Board Member”
database and a Selective Service Reserve Officer will contact you when a vacancy becomes
available.

      Residents of Arizona and Kansas will also have to include a biography.

      We appreciate your interest in serving your country with the Selective Service System.

                                                       Sincerely,

                                                       John J. Wilber
                                                       Region Director

        Delivery Processes

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Agency
        Support Processes
Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                         SSS Board Member Application

                                                    Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520

   The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President.
However, there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who
would be willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as
SSS Board Members.

A. Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

          1. You MUST:
                   a. be a citizen of the United States;
                   b. be at least 18 years of age;
                   c. reside in the county/borough/parish in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                   d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                   e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                   f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.
          2. You MAY NOT:
                   a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                   b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                   c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                   d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                   e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                               i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                               ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                               iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                   f. have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under charges for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                   fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) you have since
                   displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

B. Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
   Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of 5 members and membership of
   each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the Registrants within its
   jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

C. Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine whether the basic eligibility requirements are
   met. Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling
   out the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of
   Pay and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

D. Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately 5 hours of initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
   training consisting of 2 hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board Members
   are unable to attend 3 consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their position.

E. Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meetings as a
   Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption or postponement of induction.
   Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
   sessions and Board meetings.

F. Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
   conducting SSS duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit. Board
   Members do receive satisfaction knowing that they have had vital role in insuring that our nation’s defense manpower needs have been met in a just and
   impartial manner.

G. Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
   form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
   abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

Thanks so much for taking the time yesterday morning to talk, and for calling me
back.  I appreciate your willingness to step-up and serve, and from our
discussion, I think this will be a great fit for you and for the Selective
Service Organization.

As discussed, I have attached the application for Board Member (form 404) please
fill it out (including SSN) and submit it to either myself and/or Ms. Kidwell
(copied on this e-mail).  We will process your application, and then conduct a
""formal"" interview.  Again, I think our conversation yesterday pretty much
covered all aspects of an ""interview"", but we will cover a few more things and
go into a bit more detail on training, etc.

As I mentioned, please let me know if you have ANY questions about the program
or the process.

Thank you so much for your service - I'm really looking forward to working with
you!

Regards,

                                                         SSS Board Member Application

                                                    Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520

   The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President.
However, there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who
would be willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as
SSS Board Members.

A. Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

          1. You MUST:
                   a. be a citizen of the United States;
                   b. be at least 18 years of age;
                   c. reside in the county/borough/parish in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                   d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                   e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                   f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.
          2. You MAY NOT:
                   a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                   b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                   c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                   d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                   e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                               i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                               ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                               iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                   f. have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under charges for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                   fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) you have since
                   displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

B. Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
   Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of 5 members and membership of
   each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the Registrants within its
   jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

C. Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine whether the basic eligibility requirements are
   met. Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling
   out the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of
   Pay and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

D. Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately 5 hours of initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
   training consisting of 2 hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board Members
   are unable to attend 3 consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their position.

E. Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meetings as a
   Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption or postponement of induction.
   Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
   sessions and Board meetings.

F. Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
   conducting SSS duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit. Board
   Members do receive satisfaction knowing that they have had vital role in insuring that our nation’s defense manpower needs have been met in a just and
   impartial manner.

G. Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
   form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
   abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

                                                           SSS Board Member Application

                                                     Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520
    The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President. However,
there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who would be
willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as SSS
Board Members.

   A.   Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

               1.    You MUST:
                         a. be a citizen of the United States;
                         b. be at least 18 years of age;
                         c. reside in the county in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                         d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                         e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                         f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.

               2.    You MAY NOT:
                         a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                         b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                         c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                         d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                         e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                                     i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                                    ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                                   iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                         f.  have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under changes for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                             fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) the person has since
                             displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

   B.   Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
        Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of five members and membership of
        each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the registrants within its
        jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

   C.   Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine where the basic eligibility requirements are met.
        Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling out
        the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of Pay
        and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

   D.   Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately five hours initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
        training consisting of two hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board
        Members are unable to attend three consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their positions.

   E.   Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meeting as a
        Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption and postponement of induction.
        Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
        sessions and Board meetings.

   F.   Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
        conducting SSS Duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit.

   G.   Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
        form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
        abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

        Support Processes
Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                           SSS Board Member Application

                                                     Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520
    The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President. However,
there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who would be
willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as SSS
Board Members.

   A.   Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

               1.    You MUST:
                         a. be a citizen of the United States;
                         b. be at least 18 years of age;
                         c. reside in the county in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                         d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                         e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                         f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.

               2.    You MAY NOT:
                         a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                         b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                         c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                         d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                         e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                                     i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                                    ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                                   iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                         f.  have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under changes for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                             fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) the person has since
                             displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

   B.   Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
        Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of five members and membership of
        each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the registrants within its
        jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

   C.   Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine where the basic eligibility requirements are met.
        Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling out
        the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of Pay
        and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

   D.   Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately five hours initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
        training consisting of two hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board
        Members are unable to attend three consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their positions.

   E.   Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meeting as a
        Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption and postponement of induction.
        Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
        sessions and Board meetings.

   F.   Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
        conducting SSS Duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit.

   G.   Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
        form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
        abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

prepardness community that anticipates and responds to the
changing nees of the Nation.

                       MISSION STATEMENT

seek and are granted conscientious objector status.

                            CORE VALUES

Timeliness, fairness, equity, and respect for customers and co-
workers. Flexibility, creativity, and efficiency in the fulfillment of our
mission.

                                GOALS

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the
        Registration Process

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Personnel
        Delivery Processes

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Agency
        Support Processes
Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                           SSS Board Member Application

                                                     Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520
    The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President. However,
there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who would be
willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as SSS
Board Members.

   A.   Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

               1.    You MUST:
                         a. be a citizen of the United States;
                         b. be at least 18 years of age;
                         c. reside in the county in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                         d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                         e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                         f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.

               2.    You MAY NOT:
                         a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                         b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                         c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                         d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                         e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                                     i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                                    ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                                   iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                         f.  have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under changes for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                             fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) the person has since
                             displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

   B.   Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
        Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of five members and membership of
        each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the registrants within its
        jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

   C.   Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine where the basic eligibility requirements are met.
        Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling out
        the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of Pay
        and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

   D.   Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately five hours initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
        training consisting of two hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board
        Members are unable to attend three consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their positions.

   E.   Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meeting as a
        Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption and postponement of induction.
        Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
        sessions and Board meetings.

   F.   Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
        conducting SSS Duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit.

   G.   Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
        form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
        abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

        Delivery Processes

Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                           SSS Board Member Application

                                                     Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520
    The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President. However,
there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who would be
willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as SSS
Board Members.

   A.   Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

               1.    You MUST:
                         a. be a citizen of the United States;
                         b. be at least 18 years of age;
                         c. reside in the county in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                         d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                         e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                         f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.

               2.    You MAY NOT:
                         a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                         b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                         c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                         d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                         e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                                     i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                                    ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                                   iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                         f.  have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under changes for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                             fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) the person has since
                             displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

   B.   Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
        Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of five members and membership of
        each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the registrants within its
        jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

   C.   Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine where the basic eligibility requirements are met.
        Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling out
        the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of Pay
        and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

   D.   Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately five hours initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
        training consisting of two hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board
        Members are unable to attend three consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their positions.

   E.   Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meeting as a
        Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption and postponement of induction.
        Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
        sessions and Board meetings.

   F.   Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
        conducting SSS Duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit.

   G.   Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
        form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
        abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

                          VISION STATEMENT

The Selective Service will be an active partner in the national
prepardness community that anticipates and responds to the
changing nees of the Nation.

                       MISSION STATEMENT

The Selective Service System will provide trained and untrained
personnel to the Department of Defense in the event of a national
emergency. Also, the Selective Service System will provide an
Alternative Service Program for those from the manpower pool who
seek and are granted conscientious objector status.

                            CORE VALUES

Timeliness, fairness, equity, and respect for customers and co-
workers. Flexibility, creativity, and efficiency in the fulfillment of our
mission.

                                GOALS

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the
        Registration Process

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Personnel
        Delivery Processes

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Agency
        Support Processes
Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                           SSS Board Member Application

                                                     Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520
    The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President. However,
there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who would be
willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as SSS
Board Members.

   A.   Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

               1.    You MUST:
                         a. be a citizen of the United States;
                         b. be at least 18 years of age;
                         c. reside in the county in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                         d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                         e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                         f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.

               2.    You MAY NOT:
                         a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                         b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                         c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                         d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                         e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                                     i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                                    ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                                   iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                         f.  have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under changes for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                             fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) the person has since
                             displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

   B.   Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
        Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of five members and membership of
        each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the registrants within its
        jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

   C.   Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine where the basic eligibility requirements are met.
        Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling out
        the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of Pay
        and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

   D.   Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately five hours initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
        training consisting of two hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board
        Members are unable to attend three consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their positions.

   E.   Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meeting as a
        Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption and postponement of induction.
        Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
        sessions and Board meetings.

   F.   Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
        conducting SSS Duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit.

Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

                                                           SSS Board Member Application

                                                     Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520
    The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President. However,
there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who would be
willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as SSS
Board Members.

   A.   Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

               1.    You MUST:
                         a. be a citizen of the United States;
                         b. be at least 18 years of age;
                         c. reside in the county in which the Board has jurisdiction;
                         d. be able to devote sufficient time to accomplish Board Member duties;
                         e. be willing to apply the SSS law and Regulations fairly and uniformly; and
                         f. be registered with the SSS, if required to do so.

               2.    You MAY NOT:
                         a. be an active or retired member of the Armed Forces or any Reserve Component;
                         b. have 20 or more cumulative years of prior SSS Board Membership;
                         c. be employed by public or private enterprise which handles SSS matters;
                         d. be a member of a law enforcement occupation as defined by SSS policy (example: police officer or judge);
                         e. be a SSS employee or a spouse of:
                                     i. a compensated or uncompensated employee of the SSS;
                                    ii. a Reserve Officer assigned to the SSS; or
                                   iii. an appointee to any other SSS Board.
                         f.  have been convicted, forfeited collateral, or are now under changes for a criminal offense, other than a traffic offense with only a
                             fine of $400.00 or less; except if a conviction is (1) older than 10 years (2) it was for a misdemeanor, and (3) the person has since
                             displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

   B.   Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
        Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of five members and membership of
        each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the registrants within its
        jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

   C.   Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine where the basic eligibility requirements are met.
        Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling out
        the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of Pay
        and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

   D.   Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately five hours initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
        training consisting of two hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board
        Members are unable to attend three consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their positions.

   E.   Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meeting as a
        Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption and postponement of induction.
        Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
        sessions and Board meetings.

   F.   Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
        conducting SSS Duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit.

   G.   Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
        form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
        abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

                          VISION STATEMENT

The Selective Service will be an active partner in the national
prepardness community that anticipates and responds to the
changing nees of the Nation.

                       MISSION STATEMENT

The Selective Service System will provide trained and untrained
personnel to the Department of Defense in the event of a national
emergency. Also, the Selective Service System will provide an
Alternative Service Program for those from the manpower pool who
seek and are granted conscientious objector status.

                            CORE VALUES

Timeliness, fairness, equity, and respect for customers and co-
workers. Flexibility, creativity, and efficiency in the fulfillment of our
mission.

                                GOALS

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the
        Registration Process

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Personnel
        Delivery Processes

•       Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Agency
        Support Processes
Thank you for your interest in the Selective Service System. The
following information is provided to give you a brief overview of
the Selective Service System in general, and the Board Member
Program specifically. This publication will not attempt to describe
the many facets of board functions and operations. A thorough
training program has been developed for this purpose and, if you
are selected, will be provided to you at a later date.

The Selective Service System is an independent Agency within
the Executive Branch of the Federal government. The legislation
under which the Agency operates is the Military Selective Service
Act (MSSA).

The MSSA, along with its implementing regulations, provides that
the structure of the Agency include a National Headquarters, a
State Headquarters in each state, and one each for New York City,
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

The current structure of the Selective Service System also includes
three Region Headquarters. The National Headquarters and Region
Headquarters make up the contingency of full-time employees of
Selective Service. See Figure 1 below.

                 Figure 1 - Agency Structure
The Mission of the Selective Service is to provide manpower to
the Department of Defense for military service in the event of a
national emergency declared by the Congress or the President;
implement an Alternative Service Program for registrants classified
as conscientious objectors; and, maintain a program to conscript
health care personnel when directed. The all-volunteer armed
force, instituted in 1973, was never intended to stand alone in
time of emergency. In the event of conflict, the armed forces will
be quickly augmented by the National Guard and the Reserves. If
necessary, the Selective Service System will be mobilized to direct
registrants to the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
around the country.

The first step to be taken in the event of a health care (i.e. Special
Skills Draft) or general conscription would be to conduct a lottery
to assign random sequence numbers to determine the order in
which registrants are ordered for an Armed Forces examination,
and if found qualified, inducted. If a registrant believes that he
qualifies for a deferment or exemption, he may file a claim with a
Selective Service Area Office. Receipt of such a claim will delay the
reporting date of the registrant until his claim has been adjudicated.

                  Figure 2 - Board Structure
Information explaining the process for claiming a postponement,
deferment or exemption will be available to registrants.

The MSSA and Selective Service regulations provide for the
formation of Local Boards, allocated according to county or
corresponding political subdivision. There is also a provision for
appeal boards to be established according to Federal judicial
districts. In addition, a National Appeal Board will be established.

The appeal boards act in cases of persons who do not agree with
the classification given to them by the Local Boards. In addition, the
District Appeal Boards will act on claims relating to job assignments
from Alternative Service Workers. All board members serve without
pay. Board Members are appointed by the Director of Selective
Service in the name of the President, upon the recommendation
of the Governor or comparable executive official. Board Members
must reside within the area served by the board to which they
are appointed. Under conditions requiring the induction of health
care personnel, Selective Service will create National and State
Health Care Personnel Advisory Committees comprised of medical
specialists and others to provide independent advice on national
and local health care issues to the Director, and to local and appeal
boards.

The law requires that the membership of each board be
proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the
registrants in the area it serves, to the maximum extent practicable.
Figure 2, on the previous page, identifies the Selective Service
System boards and health care advisory committees.

History has shown that of those registrants reporting daily to the
MEPS, approximately 50% will be found acceptable. Figure 3,
on the next page, illustrates the critical role accurate and prompt
decisions on requests for deferment and exemption play in the
operation of the entire system. If these decisions are not rapid
and fair, a great deal of inequity will result. Our board members,
representing the counties and local communities across the Nation,
will be called upon to make these decisions. These important
volunteer citizens are charged with protecting the individual rights
of all registrants presenting claims. Board members will make
significant judgments about each registrant’s claim for deferment or
exemption from military service.

                    Figure 3 - Induction Flow

There are two types of classifications. They are “Administrative” and
“Judgmental.” Administrative claims are either granted or denied by
compensated personnel assigned to an Area Office. If his claim is
denied, the registrant may request a review by his Local Board.
Judgmental claims will be brought before the Local Boards for initial
consideration. If his claim is denied, the registrant may request a
higher level review from the District Appeal Board.
The following is a list of the Judgmental Classifications:

       1-A-O Conscientious objector available for
             noncombatant military service only
       1-O   Conscientious objector to all military service
       2-AM Essentiality of Occupation (health care only)
       2-D   Deferred because of study preparing for the
             ministry
       3-A   Deferred because of hardship to dependents
       4-D   Minister of religion

You will note that the only difference between the health care
registrant classification identifier and that of the general registrant
is the M signifying “medical”, i.e., 3-AM.

There is no current requirement for the Selective Service System
to provide manpower to the Department of Defense. If and when
Selective Service is called upon to provide manpower, the integrity
and credibility of the entire conscription process will depend on a
fair and effective classification process maintained by highly able,
trusted and objective leaders in local communities.

 Accordingly, each Board Member will receive formal training in the
interpretation of Selective Service regulations for processing claims
submitted by registrants. One of the criteria for appointment is that
Board Members are willing and able to participate in the training
that Selective Service provides. Upon activation the skills acquired
during the training sessions will be utilized.

I trust this message finds you, your family and your friends healthy.

The Team Oregon support element has been trying to fill Local Board Member (LBM)
positions throughout Oregon, and while we have added 41 LBMs to Team Oregon over
the last two years, we still need another 21 to fill all vacancies.  Of those 21
vacancies, 1 in in Washington County.

So, I'm reaching out to ask if you know of anybody that might be interested in
serving as a Selective Service System LBM.  If so, would you please, either:

1) Refer them to www.sss.gov (then to the ""Volunteer"" tab) where they can submit
their information to SSS HQ and we will reach out to them once we have their
contact information and discuss the next steps, or

2) Forward the attached LBM application to the interested individual, which they
can then send back to me once it is completed.  Once I have the application, I
will contact them to discuss the SSS LBM program and conduct the short
interview.  This is the fastest method to become a LBM.

The following is a list of vacancies, by county.  If you know of anyone that
resides in any one of these counties would you please consider reaching out to
them to inquire about their interest in serving as a LBM?

1) Multnomah - 4

2) Columbia - 1

3) Washington - 1

4) Marion - 4

5) Benton - 1

6) Linn - 2

7) Lane - 3

8) Coos - 1

9) Curry - 1

10) Lake - 1

11) Deschutes - 1

12) Jefferson - 1

Many thanks for your support of the SSS LBM program - your continued service is
truly appreciated.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need anything
from your Team Oregon support element.

Regards,

LTC John Buehler

                                                           SSS Board Member Application

                                                     Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual - Chapter 520
    The Selective Service System (SSS) is seeking applicants to serve as uncompensated members of the SSS Boards. There is no plan to begin inducting
young men into military service at this time. Before inductions could be resumed, a law must be passed by Congress and approved by the President. However,
there is a need to make the SSS ready to operate should it become necessary. Consequently, it is necessary that we select and train citizens who would be
willing to serve if needed.

   Completing the attached information sheet does not obligate you to accept an appointment nor does it constitute an offer of an appointment. Each individual
selected for recommendation will be contacted to determine availability. This application is the first step in identifying individuals who are willing to serve as SSS
Board Members.

   A.   Eligibility Requirements: In order to be considered for appointment on a Board,

               1.    You MUST:
                         a. be a citizen of the United States;
                         b. be at least 18 years of age;
                         c. reside in the county in which the Board has jurisdiction;

                             since displayed outstanding integrity in the community.

   B.   Appointment: Local Board Members are appointed by the Director after recommendation by the Governor of their State. District Appeal Board
        Members are appointed by the Director upon recommendation of a Region Director. Each SSS Board is composed of five members and membership of
        each Board should, to the maximum extent possible, be proportionately representative of the race and national origin of the registrants within its
        jurisdiction. No citizen will be denied membership based on gender.

   C.   Selection: Individuals are selected by a process which begins with preliminary screening to determine where the basic eligibility requirements are met.
        Personal interviews will be conducted with those persons found eligible. A prospective Board Member’s indication of willingness to serve by filling out
        the attached form is not a guarantee of a recommendation or a final commitment to serve. Each nominee will sign an Oath of Office and Waiver of Pay
        and receive written confirmation of appointment before serving as a Board Member.

   D.   Training: Each Board Member may receive approximately five hours initial training in members’ duties and responsibilities, as well as continuation
        training consisting of two hours, which may be scheduled yearly. Board Members training may also be kept current by various mailings. If Board
        Members are unable to attend three consecutively scheduled training sessions, they will be asked to resign or will be removed from their positions.

   E.   Responsibilities: Board Members are responsible for keeping abreast of changing regulations and procedures by attending training and meeting as a
        Board as scheduled, as often as necessary, to consider and decide on Registrants’ claim(s) for deferment, exemption and postponement of induction.
        Decisions of Local Boards are subject to appeal. Because Board Members are key to the success of the SSS, they are asked to attend all training
        sessions and Board meetings.

   F.   Remuneration: Board Members receive no pay for serving on the Board. They are, however, reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred while
        conducting SSS Duties. This includes travel to required training sessions and to Board meetings. Remuneration will occur via Direct Deposit.

  G.    Application: If you meet the eligibility requirements in Section A and are interested in being considered for appointment, please complete the attached
        form and give it to the assisting official present or forward it to the appropriate SSS Region Headquarters indicated below. Locate your state
        abbreviation; this will designate the Region Headquarters address.

Independent journalist Rosemary Frey is one of the rarest to debunk the
erroneous theory of ""variants"" been promoted by wood Van Bossche, Montegnier and
even Dr Robert Malone; lots of other doctors behind the C19 fraud also continue
to speak as if 1) the C19 is real which is not, and 2) variants are dangerous
which are not. To dispel any doubts about this subject, here is what Dr Mike
Yeadon said about 'varianys':
 -""No variant differs from the original sequence by more than 0.3%. In other
words, all variants are at least 99.7% identical to the Wuhan sequence... It's a
fiction, and an evil one at that, that variants are likely to 'escape
immunity'.""
And this is if C19 was real, which is not; C19 fails Koch Postulates, it was
never isolated and identified in laboratory - so as we can see, most doctors on
our side of this fight are also spreading lies and misinfo

DR MIKE YEADON
The new world order ...
 Phase 1: Simulate a threat and create fear.  (December 2019-March 2020)
 - Mount a pandemic in China.
 - Kill tens of thousands of elderly people.
 - Increase the number of cases and deaths
 - Position vaccination as the only solution from the beginning.
 - Focus all attention on Covid-19.
 Result, (almost) general panic
 Phase 2: Sow the tares and division.  (March 2020-December 2020)
 - Impose multiple unnecessary, liberticidal and unconstitutional coercive
measures.

virus and the disease.
 - Recover the notion of a variant as a natural mutation of the virus.
 - Justify the maintenance of coercive measures by not applying the herd
immunity threshold.
 - Punish health professionals for the illegal exercise of care and healing.  -
 Result, doubts and feelings of betrayal among the vaxx, discouragement among
opponents.
 Phase 4: Install Apartheid and the QR code.  (June 2021-October 2021)
 - Voluntarily plan for shortages.
 - Impose the vaccination pass (QR code) to reward the vaccinated, punish the
resistant.
 - Create an Apartheid of the privileged against the others.
 - Take away the right to work or study from non-vaxx.
 - Withdraw basic services to the non-vaxx.
 - Impose PCR payment tests on non-vaxx.
 Result, First stage of digital control, impoverishment of opponents
 Phase 5: Establish chaos and Martial law.  (November 2021-March 2022)
 - Exploit the shortage of goods and food.
 - Cause the paralysis of the real economy and the closure of factories and
shops.
 - Let unemployment explode.
 - Apply a third dose to the vaxx (boosters).
 - Take up the murder of the living old men.

the herd.

 - Arrest opposition leaders.
 - Impose digital identity on everyone (QR code): Birth certificate, identity
document, passport, driving license, health insurance card ...
 - Establish martial law to defeat the opposition.
 Result, Second stage of digital control.  Imprisonment or removal of opponents.
 Phase 6: Cancel the debts and dematerialize the money.  (March 2022-September
2022)
 - Trigger the economic, financial and stock market collapse, the bankruptcy of
the banks.
 - To rescue the losses of the banks in the accounts of their clients.
 - Activate the «Great Reset».
 - Dematerialize money.
 - Cancel debts, loans and loans.
 - Impose the digital portfolio.  (Digital Wallet)
 - Seize properties and land.
 - Ban all global medicines.
 - Confirm the obligation to vaccinate semi-annually or annually.
 - Impose food rationing and a diet based on the Codex Alimentarius.
 - Extend the measures to emerging countries.
 Result, Third stage of digital control.  Extension of the N.O.M.  to the whole
planet.
This from the Costa Rica site but it looks universal.
We’re moving into the state that includes arresting the leaders of the
resistance.

                                       PREFACE

                           (Translated by Victor E. Marsden)

The author of this translation of the famous Protocols was himself a victim of the
Revolution. He had lived for many years in Russia and was married to a Russian lady.
Among his other activities in Russia he had been for a number of years a Russian
Correspondent of the MORNING POST, a position which he occupied when the
Revolution broke out, and his vivid descriptions of events in Russia will still be in the
recollection of many of the readers of that Journal. Naturally he was singled out for the
anger of the Soviet. On the day that Captain Cromie was murdered by Jews, Victor
Marsden was arrested and thrown into the Peter-Paul Prison, expecting every day to have
his name called out for execution. This, however, he escaped, and eventually he was
allowed to return to England very much of a wreck in bodily health. However, he
recovered under treatment and the devoted care of his wife and friends. One of the first
things he undertook, as soon as he was able, was this translation of the Protocols. Mr.
Marsden was eminently well qualified for the work. His intimate acquaintance with
Russia, Russian life and the Russian language on the one hand, and his mastery of a terse
literary English style on the other, placed him in a position of advantage which few others
could claim. The consequence is that we have in his version an eminently readable work,
and though the subject-matter is somewhat formless, Mr. Marsden's literary touch reveals
the thread running through the twenty-four Protocols.

It may be said with truth that this work was carried out at the cost of Mr. Marsden's own
life's blood. He told the writer of this Preface that he could not stand more than an hour at
a time of his work on it in the British Museum, as the diabolical spirit of the matter which
he was obliged to turn into English made him positively ill.

Mr. Marsden's connection with the MORNING POST was not severed by his return to
England, and he was well enough to accept the post of special correspondent of that
journal in the suite of H.R.H., the Prince of Wales on his Empire tour. From this he
returned with the Prince, apparently in much better health, but within a few days of his
landing he was taken suddenly ill, and died after a very brief illness.

May this work be his crowning monument! In it he has performed an immense service to
the English-speaking world, and there can be little doubt that it will take its place in the

DR MIKE YEADON
Wherever we look, the situation is LESS serious than a year ago.
This despite obvious fraud, cheating, misleading use of statistics & crude
manipulation of the evidence.
Ask yourself, why are they doing this?
It’s clearly NOT for reasons of public health.
Once you allow yourself that one, unavoidable deduction, it’s impossible,
without intellectual schizophrenia, to be at ease about what’s going on any
longer.
Not about public health.
Surely the next thought is to ask the question: “SO, WHAT IS DRIVING THIS?”
What’s happening? Well, small & medium sized businesses are collapsing into
bankruptcy at a huge rate.
This is vital because it previously employed one third of the workforce, who
paid taxes & helped fund public sector employment.
What else? Well, our budget deficit is eye-wateringly high. For the first time
in the hundreds of years of the Bank of England’s history, we are no longer even
making a pretence of operating a policy of “sound money”. Previously, we
borrowed from investors through issuance of sovereign debt, so-called gilt-edged
certificates or “gilts”.
These are assumed to be “risk free”, will always be repaid.
We’re not doing that. Why, I don’t know.
One possibility is that there are insufficient takers of such debt issuance. If
true, that’s utter disaster territory. It tells the market that “there’s no
confidence that U.K. is able to service & repay it’s debts”.
What they’re doing instead is appalling.
The BoE is virtually printing sterling, backed by nothing more substantial than
a here today, gone tomorrow government promise to repay it, sometime.
I heard a very experienced financial services person say a few days ago that he
couldn’t see any way to prevent the irreversible destruction of sterling, and
quite soon, too. Months not years.
If that happens, all the pension promises you think you hold are void.
They can’t be honoured so they won’t be.
I believe the “measures” have several objectives, one of which is to destroy our
& others sovereign currencies.
That will force a global central bank “solution” on everyone, and that would be
wholly beyond any democratic influence, let alone control.
Cash & sovereign currencies will vanish, replaced by CBDCs.
This converges perfectly with population wide “vaccination” & issuance of
digital ID (aka VaxPass).
If you’re not seeing it now, I fear you never will.
Best wishes
Mike

 DR ROBERT MALONE
Before You Inject Your Child
My name is Robert Malone, and I am speaking to you as a parent, grandparent,
physician and scientist. I don’t usually read from a prepared speech, but this
is so important that I wanted to make sure that I get every single word and
scientific fact correct.
I stand by this statement with a career dedicated to vaccine research and
development. I’m vaccinated for COVID and I'm generally pro-vaccination. I have
devoted my entire career to developing safe and effective ways to prevent and
treat infectious diseases.
Before you inject your child - a decision that is irreversible - I wanted to let
you know the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine, which is based on the
mRNA vaccine technology I created:
There are three issues parents need to understand:
● The first is that a viral gene will be injected into your children's cells.
This gene forces your child’s body to make toxic spike proteins. These proteins
often cause permanent damage in children’s critical organs, including
○ Their brain and nervous system
○ Their heart and blood vessels, including blood clots
○ Their reproductive system
○ And this vaccine can trigger fundamental changes to their immune system
● The most alarming point about this is that once these damages have occurred,
they are irreparable
○ You can’t fix the lesions within their brain
○ You can’t repair heart tissue scarring
○ You can’t repair a genetically reset immune system, and
○ This vaccine can cause reproductive damage that could affect future
generations of your family
● The second thing you need to know about is the fact that this novel technology
has not been adequately tested.
○ We need at least 5 years of testing/research before we can really understand
the risks
○ Harms and risks from new medicines often become revealed many years later
● Ask yourself if you want your own child to be part of the most radical medical
experiment in human history
● One final point: the reason they’re giving you to vaccinate your child is a
lie.
○ Your children represent no danger to their parents or grandparents
○ It’s actually the opposite. Their immunity, after getting COVID, is critical
to save your family if not the world from this disease
In summary: there is no benefit for your children or your family to be
vaccinating your children against the small risks of the virus, given the known
health risks of the vaccine that as a parent, you and your children may have to
live with for the rest of their lives.
The risk/benefit analysis isn’t even close.
As a parent and grandparent, my recommendation to you is to resist and fight to
protect your children.

   Deaths of Despair
   Child suicide evidence package

takeactioncanada.ca
“Settled science shows
   that children do drive
   influenza into the home
   but do not drive COVID-19
   into the home.”
 — Dr. Paul E Alexander, MSc PhD
  McMaster University and GUIDE
         Research Methods Group
                                                                             deaths of despair

While we typically see an increase in mental health issues, substance
abuse, suicide attempts and suicide ideation with adults during periods
of rising unemployment and economic recession, we have never before
seen suicidality among our children rise at such alarming rates as we
have during the lockdowns of 2020/21 in Canada and around the world.
While the lives of adults and parents are important, it is our goal to bring much-needed
attention to rising rates of attempted and successful child suicide during the lockdowns.
These are a foreseeable consequence of the long and harsh lockdowns, and therefore
are attributable to lockdown measures, which resulted in lengthy absences from school,
isolation, reduced (or eliminated) social and sporting activity, loss of routines and many
other ordinary behaviours and experiences that children require for adequate social
development and mental health.

One might argue that our provincial governments’ initial decisions to go into lockdowns
based on theoretical disease projection models were justified. Yet the World Health
Organization (WHO), in its 2019 guidance paper for Public Health authorities on non-
pharmaceutical measures to mitigate pandemics, recommended against lockdowns
under any circumstances1. However, even if one ignores the fact that lockdowns were
unprecedented and never recommended by Public Health authorities before 2020, they are
definitively not an acceptable strategy option. We now have over 15 months of outcome data
that clearly show lockdowns resulted in widespread harm to mental health and educational
outcomes for children without delivering unambiguous benefits to counterbalance the harm2.
Our governments and Public Health officials have failed in their responsibility to our children
to balance risk and benefit in their decisions during this pandemic.

We have known for at least a year that statistically, children are at extremely low risk of
serious illness or death by COVID-19, except in rare circumstances in which they suffer
from a compromised immune system, cancer, or other pre-existing health challenges.
Results from almost 80 studies have not only shown that children are not so-called
“super-spreaders”, but also that there has been nil transmission of COVID-19 to adults
by children under 10 years of age3. According to Dr. Paul E. Alexander, MSc, PhD
(McMaster University and GUIDE Research Methods Group), children are at very low
                                                                                                  | Child suicide evidence package
risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection and are also at a low risk of spreading it to others
in a school setting4.

Despite the early reports that suggested asymptomatic transmission was not a material
contributing factor to adult infection, our governments enacted lockdowns resulting in
lengthy school closures and other severe disruptions to our children’s lives in response
to a virus that is statistically less dangerous to them than regular seasonal influenza5.
                                                                                                           deaths of despair

                                                                                                              4
                                   deaths of despair

                                   Recent research clearly shows that children with COVID-19 do not
                                   often spread it to adults; in addition, it has been determined that
                                   the few children who acquire COVID-19 are predominantly catching the disease
                                   at home and from their parents6. Receiving in-class instruction at school is
                                   safe for children (arguably safer than being at home, statistically speaking) and
                                   for university-aged young people. It is also safe for the adult teachers and school
                                   administrators.

                                   This may be the first time in recent history that adults at a societal level are not
                                   focused on protecting children, but are instead willing to expose them to mental
                                   health and other risks in order to (theoretically) protect adults from a respiratory
                                   virus that is statistically hardly more dangerous than seasonal influenza, except
                                   for the very old and infirm.

                                   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the survival rates
                                   for people who get infected with COVID-19 by age and without treatment are:

                                         AGES               SURVIVAL RATES

                                         0-19               99.997%
                                       20-49                99.98%
                                       50-69                99.5%
                                           70+              94.6%

                                   For the 0-19 age group, a survival rate of 99.997% implies a
                                   minuscule death rate of 0.003%, i.e., 3 children out of every 100,000 infected are
                                   statistically expected to die. Note that of the 335 children (under 18) who had died
                                   with or of COVID-19 in the US (as at mid-July 2021), 100% of them had a pre-existing
                                   medical condition, such as cancer7. In contrast, the CDC estimates that 434 children
                                   died of influenza in the 2019-2020 season, and only 43% of the reported cases involved
| Child suicide evidence package

                                   children with known pre-existing conditions8.

                                   Canadian statistics tell a similar story. According to Statistics Canada, in the 5 years
                                   before COVID-19 an average of 25 children aged 0–19 died of influenza each year9.
                                   In the 15 months since the pandemic was declared, 11 children died with COVID,
                                   all of whom had comorbidities. These statistics demonstrate clearly that Influenza is
                                   approximately twice as deadly to Canadian children as COVID-19. Only children with
         deaths of despair

                                   serious underlying medical conditions are at risk of death from COVID-19, and even
                                   then, that risk is lower than that of endemic seasonal influenza, which we have all
                                   tolerated every single year without any special, let alone world-changing, precautions.

            5                                                                                                                 Photo by MH Cheraghi from Pexels
                                                                          deaths of despair

Furthermore, following early reports that suggested asymptomatic transmission (the
main means by which children might be vectors of COVID-19) was not a contributing
factor, we now have compelling recent data indicating that asymptomatic transmission
of COVID-19 is a negligible factor, if it exists at all10.

We have presented the data that indicate that, whatever the seriousness of COVID-19
as a general public health issue, it is most certainly not a serious health issue for
children, nor does allowing children to get on with their busy, interactive lives at school
and elsewhere exacerbate the spread of COVID-19 to adults. Yet we have allowed our
governments to pretend otherwise. Let us turn now to the damage that this has wrought.

Here is the evidence. McMaster Children’s Hospital, in Hamilton, Ontario, reported an
almost 300% increase in youth suicide attempts between October 2020 and January
2021 compared to the same time period the previous year11. To be specific, there
were 7 youth admissions in the four months to January 2020, compared to 26 in the
corresponding period to January 2021. You might be tempted to think, “These are small
numbers, compared to the children at risk from COVID-19.” That would be an incorrect
assertion. The facts are that in the entire province of Ontario, a total of 5 deaths with/
from COVID-19 have been reported for all people under age 2012. More than
5 times as many children attempted suicide in a single
Ontario Region in a 4-month period of lockdowns as died
with COVID-19 in the entire Province of Ontario since the
start of the pandemic.
The McMaster Children’s Hospital reporting refers only to unsuccessful suicide attempts
reported in one region of one Canadian province. From this alone, it is very reasonable to
infer that the total numbers of completed suicides and attempted suicides for people
under 20 years of age in Ontario as a whole are at least one order of magnitude higher
than COVID-19 related deaths in the same age bracket, despite media reports being
hard to come by. And according to a Canadian Parliamentary report on youth suicide
attempts, for every completed suicide, there may be as many as 22 visits to the emergency
room and five hospital admissions for suicide attempts13.

McMaster’s experience has been widely replicated across North America and indeed
                                                                                              | Child suicide evidence package
elsewhere in the world. For instance, Pima, the second-largest county in the state
of Arizona, reported a 67% increase in child suicide during the
2020 lockdown14. Boston Children’s Hospital reported a 47% increase in
children hospitalized for suicide attempts and suicide ideation between July and
October 2020 compared to the same period in 201915.
                                                                                                       deaths of despair

                                                                                                          6
                                   deaths of despair

                                   In France, it has been reported that children, some as
                                   young as eight years old, have deliberately run into traffic,
                                   overdosed on pills and self-harmed during the lockdown.
                                   And in Japan, the education ministry reported that child
                                   and adolescent suicides hit record levels16.

                                   In March 2021, a British infirmary reported that they previously treated between one
                                   and two children per week for mental health and suicide attempts, but that during
                                   the lockdown they were treating an average of two per day, with some of the children
                                   as young as eight years old17. And in January 2021, the UK Centre
                                   for Mental Health announced that 500,000 children in
                                   England under the age of 18 with no previous issues
                                   would need mental health care due to the lockdown18.                                              Photo by Dids from Pexels

UK... everything is open, not much restrictions all around,
apart from just one place: my local parish, St Joseph.
It's the only place where I have been harassed because of masks, washing hands,
social distancing and keeping tabs of who goes to Mass, etc.
Right now and since june last year that all football stadiums are filled with
dozens of thousands of people, all together clapping, shouting and socializing;
all pubs are filled with people, again no restrictions of any kind, the same for
supermarkets, shop, etc.
Only St Joseph's continues the irrational psychotic fear mongering control
measures: keeping tabs, take the temperature at the entrance bla bla bla ... now
in january, with the 'omicron' farse, last weekend I entered the church to find
even more blocked pews and the usual chairs at the back that always been there,
were turned the other side as to stop people from seating ... at a distance well
more than 2 meters... I should have taken a photo so you could see how
ridiculous it looks.
I cannot find the right word to describe this entire stupidity at my local
parish, obviously going 100% along the diabolical C19 global fraud, always very
keen to obey all the little rules of the secular masonic government.
The very place where we were supposed to find the truth, find peace, love,
freedom, etc... is the exact opposite; it's the only place around the entire
region which keeps the hysterical mass indoctrination c19 fraud, which keeps the
nonsensical control... a place where the fear of a stupid 'virus' replaces the
healthy fear of the Lord. Nothing being done in this parish is catholic, Jesus
teachings are rarely mentioned, no mention to Our Lady on the 1st of january ...

Prion diseases are arriving, as we spoke of last year:
Bizarre neurological illness plagues young Canadians
Dozens of young people with no preexisting conditions are developing symptoms of
a new disease as activists and families suspect a cover-up on the part of the
local government.
A whistleblower with Vitalité Health Network in New Brunswick told The Guardian
on Sunday that symptoms include hallucinations, difficulty thinking, limited
mobility, insomnia, and rapid weight loss. Local government has reportedly
struggled to dismiss the growing number of cases as Alzheimer’s or other
neurological diseases uncommon outside the elderly.
One of the more disturbing elements of the condition is how little is known
regarding transmission. In at least nine cases, caretakers and others in close
contact with sick individuals have developed similar symptoms to the ailing
party, suggesting the illness not only spreads readily between unrelated
individuals but that there may be environmental factors involved. Some have
compared the illness to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal brain disease caused
by misshapen proteins called prions, though screening reportedly produced no
confirmed CJD cases.
The province has struggled to keep the cases under wraps – the case cluster only
became public last year when a memo was leaked to the media, and the government
has insisted the “cluster” itself is merely the result of “misdiagnoses”
grouping unrelated illnesses together. Officials declared in October that eight
fatal cases were due to “known and unrelated pathologies,” rather than a shared
and unknown illness. An epidemiological report released in October supposedly
ruled out any food, behavioral, or environmental exposure that could explain the
problem.
However, another public health scientist who sought to remain anonymous
suggested the government was covering something up. “The fact that we have a
younger spectrum of patients here argues very strongly against what appears to
be the preferred position of the government of New Brunswick – that the cases in
this cluster are being mistakenly lumped together.”
Also salient, that last paragraph:  “If a group of people wanted to breed
conspiracy theorists, then our government has done a wonderful job at promoting
it,” Beatty told The Guardian. “Are they just trying to create a narrative for
the public that they hope we’ll absorb and walk away from? I just don’t
understand it.”

CELL TOWERS ON THE OCEAN FLOOR

One blue sky above us,
One ocean lapping all our shores,
One earth so green and round,
Who could ask for more?

- Pete Seeger

In 2018, on land and in space, preparations to deploy millions of antennas were very publicly
being made and advertised, for “5G,” “Smart Cities,” and the “Internet of Things.” At the same
time, and without any publicity, governments, research laboratories, and commercial and military
interests were collaborating on plans to create “Smart Oceans” and the “Internet of Underwater
Things” (IoUT). They did not consult the fishes, whales, dolphins, octopuses, and other
inhabitants of those depths.
In the United States, the National Science Foundation funded what it called the SEANet Project.
The goal was to enable broadband wireless communication from any point on or in the oceans to
anywhere else on the planet or in space. The Internet of Underwater Things is being designed to
enable all the same communication capabilities that are being provided on land, including
“real-time video streaming from underwater.”
In the last three years, a flood of papers have been published by scientists and engineers in
the U.S., China, Pakistan, Qatar, South Korea, Spain, Australia, Greece, Italy, France, Morocco,
Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. In 2020, the IEEE Internet of Things Journal published a Special
Issue on Internet of Things for Smart Ocean. In 2019, the journal Sensors published a Special
Issue on Smart Ocean: Emerging Research Advances, Prospects and Challenges, and the same journal
is now publishing another Special Issue on Internet of Underwater Things.
Some of the activities that supposedly “need” this technology in the oceans are:

  * climate change monitoring
  * pollution control and tracking
  * disaster prevention including tsunami warning systems
  * ocean exploration
  * fishing and aquaculture
  * coral reef harvesting
  * tectonic plate monitoring
  * navigation
  * global oceanic trade
  * oil and gas exploration and production
  * military communication and surveillance
The infrastructure that is beginning to be deployed, throughout the oceans, includes:

  * sensors and antennas (“nodes”) on the ocean floor
  * nodes at different depths
  * surface nodes
  * relay antennas at different depths to transmit data vertically from the ocean floor to the
    ocean surface, and horizontally between nodes
  * Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)
  * Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs)
  * underwater robots
  * wireless surface buoys
  * smart boats and ships
  * smart submarines
  * smart shores

Communication being more difficult to accomplish underwater than through the air, and more
subject to interference, several different types of communication media are being used in the
oceans to send data at different speeds and over different distances. Acoustic waves, radio
waves, lasers, LED light, and magnetic induction are all being used to flood the oceans with
data. An underwater GPS system is being developed. Most of these media work only for short- to
medium-range communication. Long-range communication relies on acoustic waves, and is similar to
the technology used in ocean sonar.

These technologies are already being marketed commercially and installed in the world’s oceans
today. At the 2022 Oceanology International conference, which will be held in London from March
15 to 17, dozens of these companies will be exhibiting their products.
WaterLinked sells underwater sensor technology through distributors around the world for use in
aquaculture, and in underwater navigation. “Our Wireless Sense™ technology enables reliable
wireless communication and innovative subsea sensor solutions,” says their website.
EvoLogics sells underwater acoustic modems, both mid-range and long-range, that “provide
full-duplex digital communication.”
SonarDyne International sells underwater acoustic modems to the oil and gas industry and to
governments and navies.
Voyis sells short- and long-range underwater laser scanners.
GeoSpectrum sells “integrated, end-to-end acoustic systems” for oil and gas exploration and for
military purposes.
Dynautics sells autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).
Seaber sells “off-the-shelf micro-AUVs.”
Hydromea markets “the first ever tether-less underwater drone.”
Mediterraneo Señales Maritimas sells “data buoys that integrate sensors through our datalogger
so the data can be transmitted to a remote station and displayed on our software.”
3D at Depth, Inc. “provides advanced subsea LIDAR laser systems.”
Teledyne Marine sells Autonomous Underwater Gliders, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (“unmanned
robot submarines”) and “laser systems for both shallow and deep-sea submerged diving.”
“Underwater robots swarm the ocean,” says a page on the website of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute. The Institute has developed an acoustic-based navigation system that is enabling
large numbers of underwater robots to work together. “Instead of using just a single, larger and
more expensive underwater robot to cover an area of the ocean, we want to have hundreds or even
thousands of smaller, lower-cost robots that can all work in sync,” says their webpage.

Ocean protection organizations have long been campaigning against noise pollution in the oceans,
but they are only beginning to be aware of this new type of assault, which has the potential to
dwarf all previous noise assaults in its scope and magnitude. For example, one of the campaigns
of the environmental organization, Sea Shepherd, is “Silencing the Deafening Roar of Ocean Noise
Pollution.” They write:

“In 1953, Jacques Cousteau published a classic memoir on his early days of underwater
exploration. He titled this book The Silent World. Today, human activities make a mockery of
that title. Over the past several decades, marine noise pollution has grown at an exponential
rate. Noise from vessel traffic is doubling every decade. Pile-driving, dredging, sonar, and
seismic exploration for oil and gas add to the cacophony. For marine wildlife, and especially
for acoustically-sensitive cetaceans, this anthropogenic racket poses a grave and growing
threat. Ocean noise pollution causes severe stress, behavioral changes, masking (i.e.,
difficulty perceiving important natural sounds), strandings, and noise-induced loss of hearing
sensitivity.”
To this mix is now being added the Internet of Underwater Things, which is beginning to flood
the oceans with sound in order to connect them to the Internet. And this sound will be
pulse-modulated with the same harmful frequencies as radio waves in order to carry the same
data. And to communicate over large distances, some of the underwater acoustic modems that are
being marketed are capable of producing sound as loud as 202 decibels. That is equivalent to 139
decibels in air. It is as loud as a jet engine at a distance of 100 feet, and is above the
threshold for pain in humans. These modems blast modulated sound at frequencies ranging from 7
kHz to 170 kHz, encompassing almost the entire hearing range of dolphins, which use sound for
hunting and navigating.

The effects of sonar on whales and dolphins have been widely publicized. But the effects of
noise pollution on fish and other denizens of the deep are just as devastating, as Lindy
Weilgart details in her 36-page report for OceanCare. She reviews 115 research studies on the
effects of noise on 66 species of fish and 36 species of invertebrates.
“Most fish and invertebrates use sound for vital life functions,” she writes. “Noise impacts on
development include body malformations, higher egg or immature mortality, developmental delays,
delays in metamorphosing and settling, and slower growth rates... Anatomical impacts from noise
involve massive internal injuries, cellular damage to statocysts and neurons, causing
disorientation and even death, and hearing loss... Behaviorally, animals showed alarm responses,
increased aggression, hiding, and flight reactions; and decreased anti-predator defense, nest
digging, nest care, courtship calls, spawning, egg clutches, and feeding... Some commercial
catches dropped by up to 80% due to noise, with larger fish leaving the area.”
If the new assault continues, it will provide the last nails in the coffins of our oceans, and
-- since the oceans are the source of all life -- of our planet. Already in 1970, just 17 years
after he published The Silent World, Jacques Cousteau, returning from 3½ years of exploration in
which he traveled 155,000 miles, told the world: “The oceans are dying. The pollution is
general.”
“People don’t realize that all pollution goes to the seas,” said Cousteau. “The earth is less
polluted. It is washed by the rain which carries everything into the oceans where life has
diminished by 40 per cent in 20 years. Fish disappear. Flora too.” And what was not being
poisoned was being mined for food as though ocean life was an inexhaustible resource. “The
oceans are being scraped,” he said. “Eggs and larvae are disappearing. In the past, the sea
renewed itself. It was a complete cycle. But this balance was upset with the appearance of
industrial civilization. Shrimps are being chased from their holes by electric shocks. Lobsters
are being sought in impossible places. Coral itself is disappearing. Even in the Indian Ocean,
which is little traveled.”
Life in the oceans today is hanging by a thread. If the rate of population declines continues,
there will be no almost fish left in the oceans by 2048. The oceans are absorbing 24 million
tons of carbon dioxide every day, are 26% more acidic than before we began burning fossil
fuels, and have absorbed 93% of the heat generated by greenhouse gases since the 1970s.
The damage already done to coral reefs by acidification, rising temperatures, and bottom
trawling would take 100,000 years for nature to repair. D",,,,,,,,,,

    Planning Human stress that human augmentation needs to be a key area of
    focus to win future wars
  * Human augmentation will not be restricted to the military ranks. It’s really

    to rule everyone else

    World Economic Forum — is transhumanism, the merging of man with machine
  * Human augmentation can directly affect behavior, either positively or to the
    detriment of that person
  * In the transhumanist view, the human body is a “platform” that can be
    augmented in myriad ways, physically, psychologically and socially

A May 2021 project report by the U.K. Ministry of Defense, created in
partnership with the German Bundeswehr Office for Defense Planning, offers
shocking highlights of the dystopian cybernetics future that global technocrats
are pushing mankind toward.

The report, “Human Augmentation — The Dawn of a New Paradigm, a Strategic
Implications Project,”1 reviews the scientific goals of the U.K. and German
defense ministries, and they are precisely what the title suggests. Human
augmentation is stressed as being a key area to focus on in order to win future
wars.

But human augmentation will not be restricted to the military ranks. It’s really
a way to further separate classes of humans, with the rich and powerful elite
being augmented “super-humans.” It’s worth noting that anything released to the
public is a decade or more behind current capabilities, so everything in this
report can be considered dated news, even though it reads like pure science
fiction.

  “... the field of human augmentation has the potential to transform society,
  security and defense over the next 30 years,” the report states. “We must
  begin to understand the implications of these changes and shape them to our
  advantage now, before they are thrust upon us.

  Technology in warfare has traditionally centered on increasingly sophisticated
  platforms that people move and fight from, or artefacts that they wear or
  wield to fight with. Advances in the life sciences and converging developments
  in related fields are, however, beginning to blur the line between technology
  and the human ...

  Many technologies that have the potential to deliver strategic advantage out
  to 2050 already exist and further advances will undoubtedly occur ... Our
  potential adversaries will not be governed by the same ethical and legal
  considerations that we are, and they are already developing human augmentation
  capabilities.

  Our key challenge will be establishing advantage in this field without
  compromising the values and freedoms that underpin our way of life ...

  When we think of human augmentation it is easy to imagine science fiction
  inspired suits or wonder drugs that produce super soldiers, but we are on the
  cusp of realizing the benefits in a range of roles now. Human augmentation
  will help to understand, optimize and enhance performance leading to
  incremental, as well as radical, improvements.”

Changing What It Means To Be Human

As noted in the report, “Human augmentation has the potential to ... change the
meaning of what it means to be a human.” This is precisely what Klaus Schwab,
founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), has stated is
the goal of The Fourth Industrial Revolution.2

WEF has been at the center of global affairs for more than 40 years, and if you
take the time to dive into WEF’s Fourth Industrial Revolution material, you
realize that it’s all about transhumanism. It’s about the merger of man and
machine. This is a dystopian future WEF and its global allies are actively
trying to implement, whether humanity at large agrees with it or not.

Schwab dreams of a world in which humans are connected to the cloud, able to
access the internet through their own brains. This, of course, also means that
your brain would be accessible to people who might like to tinker with your
thoughts, emotions, beliefs and behavior, be they the technocratic elite
themselves or random hackers. As noted by history professor Yuval Noah Harari in
late 2019, “humans are now hackable animals.”3 As noted in the featured report:4

  “Human augmentation will become increasingly relevant, partly because it can
  directly enhance human capability and behavior and partly because it is the
  binding agent between people and machines.

  Future wars will be won, not by those with the most advanced technology, but
  by those who can most effectively integrate the unique capabilities of both
  people and machines. The importance of human-machine teaming is widely
  acknowledged but it has been viewed from a techno-centric perspective.

  Human augmentation is the missing part of this puzzle. Thinking of the person
  as a platform and understanding our people at an individual level is
  fundamental to successful human augmentation.”

Key words I’d like to draw your attention to is the affirmation that human
augmentation can “directly enhance behavior.” Now, if you can enhance behavior,
that means you can change someone’s behavior. And if you can change a person’s
behavior in a positive way, you can also control it to the person’s own
detriment.

Theoretically, absolutely anyone, any random civilian with a brain-to-cloud
connection and the needed biological augmentation (such as strength or speed)
could be given wireless instructions to carry out an assassination, for example,
and pull it off flawlessly, even without prior training.

Alternatively, their physical body could temporarily be taken over by a remote
operator with the prerequisite skills. Proof of concept already exists, and is
reviewed by Dr. Charles Morgan, professor in the department of national security
at the University of New Haven, in the lecture below. Using the internet and
brain implants, thoughts can be transferred from one person to another. The
sender can also directly influence the physical movements of the receiver.

The Human Platform

On page 12 of the report, the concept of the human body as a platform is
described, and how various parts of the human platform can be augmented. For
example:

  * Physical performance such as strength, dexterity, speed and endurance can be
    enhanced, as well as physical senses. One example given is gene editing for
    enhanced sight
  * Psychological performance such as cognition, emotion and motivation can be
    influenced to activate and direct desired behavior. Examples of cognitive
    augmentation include improving memory, attention, alertness, creativity,
    understanding, decision-making, intelligence and vigilance
  * Social performance — “the ability to perceive oneself as part of a group and
    the readiness to act as part of the team” — can be influenced. Communication
    skills, collaboration and trust are also included here

They list several different ways to influence the physical, psychological and
social performance of the “human platform,” including genetics (germ line and
somatic modification), the gut microbiome, synthetic biology, invasive
(internal) and noninvasive (external) brain interfaces, passive and powered
exoskeletons, herbs, drugs and nano technology, neurostimulation, augmented
reality technologies such as external holograms or glasses with built-in
artificial intelligence, and sensory augmentation technologies such as external
sensors or implants. As noted in the report:

  “The senses can be extended by translating frequencies beyond the normal human
  range into frequencies that can been seen, heard or otherwise detected. This
  could allow the user to ‘see’ through walls, sense vibrations and detect
  airborne chemicals and changes to magnetic fields.

  More invasive options to enhance existing senses have also been demonstrated,
  for example, coating retinal cells with nanoparticles to enable vision in the
  infrared spectrum.”

They also point out that, from a defense perspective, methods to de-augment an
augmented opponent will be needed. Can you even imagine the battlefield of the
future, where soldiers are barraged from both sides with conflicting inputs?

As for ethics, the paper stresses that “we cannot wait for the ethics of human
augmentation to be decided for us.” There may even be “moral obligations” to
augment people, they say, such as when it would “promote well-being” or protect
a population from a “novel threat.”

Interestingly, the paper notes that “It could be argued that treatments
involving novel vaccination processes and gene and cell therapies are examples
of human augmentation already in the pipeline.” This appears to be a direct
reference to mRNA and vector DNA COVID jabs. If so, it’s an open admission that
they are a human augmentation strategy in progress.

The Challenge of Unintended Consequences

Of course, there can be any number of side effects and unintended outcomes when
you start augmenting an aspect of the human body or mind. As explained in the
featured report:

  “The relationship between augmentation inputs and outputs is not as simple as
  it might appear. An augmentation might be used to enhance a person’s endurance
  but could unintentionally harm their ability to think clearly and decisively
  in a timely fashion.

  In a warfighting context, an augmentation could make a commander more
  intelligent, but less able to lead due to their reduced ability to socially
  interact or because they increasingly make unethical decisions. Even a
  relatively uncontentious enhancement such as an exoskeleton may improve
  physical performance for specific tasks, but inadvertently result in a loss of
  balance or reduced coordination when not being worn.

  The notion of enhancement is clouded further by the intricacies of the human
  nervous system where a modifier in one area could have an unintended effect
  elsewhere. Variation between people makes designing enhancements even more
  challenging.”

Still, none of that is cause to reconsider or slow down the march toward
transhumanism, according to the authors. We just need to understand the human
body better, and for that, we need to collect and analyze more data on human
performance, behavior, genetics and epigenetics. As noted by the authors:

  “Devices that track movement, heart rate, oxygenation levels and location are
  already commonplace and will become increasingly accurate and sophisticated,
  making it possible to gather an increasingly wide array of performance data in
  real time. We can also analyze data in ways that were impossible even five
  years ago.

  Artificial intelligence can analyze massive sets of information almost
  instantaneously and turn it into products that can inform decision-making.
  This marriage of data collection and analytics is the foundation of future
  human augmentation.”

Lab-Grown Designer Babies

As mentioned, by the time a technological advancement is admitted publicly, the
research is already a decade or more down the road. Consider, then, the February
1, 2022, article in Futurism,5 which announced that Chinese scientists have
developed an artificial intelligence nanny robot to care for fetuses grown
inside an artificial womb. According to Futurism:6

  “The system could theoretically allow parents to grow a baby in a lab, thereby
  eliminating the need for a human to carry a child. The researchers go so far
  as to say that this system would be safer than traditional childbearing.”

As of now, the AI robot is only in charge of lab-raised animal embryos, as
“experimentation on human embryos is still forbidden under international law.”
However, that could change at any time. In May 2021, the International Society
for Stem Cell Research went ahead and relaxed the rules7 on human embryonic
experimentation.8

Up until then, the rule had been that no human embryo could be grown in a lab
environment beyond 14 days. Human embryos may now be grown beyond 14 days if
certain conditions are met. In some countries, laws would still need to be
changed to go beyond 14 days, but regardless, there’s no doubt that as
transhumanism gets underway in earnest, ethical considerations about growing
babies in laboratories will be tossed out.

Combine the announcement of an AI robot nanny to care for lab-grown embryos with
the 2018 announcement that Chinese scientists were creating CRISPR gene-edited
babies. As reported by Technology Review, November 25, 2018,9 “A daring effort

editing.”

The embryos were genetically edited to disable a gene called CCR5, to make the
babies “resistant to HIV, smallpox and cholera.” The embryos were then implanted
into a human mother using in vitro fertilization. At the time, the lead

Guys, this ""Ukraine-Russia"" thing is all a huge deception, an illusion; I
already seen quite a few videos with 'crisis actors'; these videos are
fabricated to then be shown on tv news... never believe anything coming from the

The jews of the synagogue of satan have also smeared pope Pius XII, accusing him
of collaborating with the nazis - this is a disgusting fabricated lie and I'm
attaching a file with quotations regarding this specific issue, for you to see
how many times the jews simply reverse truths...
Pope Pius XII never condemned a 'jewish holocaust' because none existed; hadd it
happened, he would have been the most active voice denouncing it, as he has done
with nazism which persecuted christians and specially catholics from day one -
in fact, catholics were the main victims of nazism, not jews,because nazism is
paganism... it's entire symbology is pagan, the symbols are germanic pagan
'runes'.
At some point, some german bishops asked Piux XII to refrain from his loud
condemnations of nazism because that could put the lives of catholics in Germany
at risk.
Read the quotes from jewish sources and see how none of them mentioned a
'holocaust'.

embraced Judaism long after the birth of Christ... The ashkanazi had no claim
whatever to a land they had never occupied.”
 Fr Andrew O'Brien, “Make yourself an Arc”:
 - “There already existed in Russia a people converted to the worship of
Jehovah, the people of the Khazar Kingdom, a tartar or mongolian people. The
jewish encyclopedia says that their chagan or chieftain with his grandees and a
large number of his heathen people embraced Judaism, probably about 679 AD.
Arthur Koestler (jewish historian) in his “the thirteenth tribe” traced the
history of the Khazars, who in the dark ages become converted to Judaism, and
later migrated to Poland and formed the cradle of western Jewry. They, of
course, had no lineal connection with the chosen people of God of the Bible, and
no rights to disposses Palestinians.”
 Lt. Col. Gordon ""Jack"" Mohr, “The Jewish Holy War Against Goyim!”:
 - There are very few jews of Abrahamic blood and these are to be found among
the group called 'Sephardim', Mediterranean jews. The much larger group,
possibly 90%, are of Oriental, Turco-Mongolian blood and their forefathers never
set foot in Palestine. These are the ones who have accepted the heathen
teachings of the TALMUD, and are ruled in their religious life, by it's filthy,
anti-God teachings. Most of their ancestors came from a heathen group known as
Khazars, from Southeastern Russia, who were converted to Judaism in the 8th
Century A.D. May I suggest that you read the jew Arthur Koestler's book ""The
Thirteenth Tribe”. The vast majority of Judaism are atheists and agnostics. They
believe the coming Messiah is the jewish nation , as it rises to prominence and
takes over control of the world, and this is what they live for. They look
forward to the day promised in their TALMUD, when ""every jew will have 2,000
goyim slaves"".
Eric Butler, “Censored History”:
 - “ The great majority of those called jews, probably at least 85%, have no
racial relationship whatsoever with Palestine. The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia
gives the history of the great Khazar Empire of Middle Asia, the people being of
mixed stock with Mongol and Turkish affinities. They were an extremely warlike
but able people. It was probably towards the end of the 8th century that King
Bulan, having called representatives of Judaism , Christianity and
Mohammedanism, decided upon Judaism as a state religion. The eminent jewish
history Professor H. Greatz, in his History of the Jews deals with the
progressive judaising of the Khazars, relating how it became the fundamental law
of the state that only jewish rulers could ascend the throne. The Khazars were
the first population of people to be called Jews in Eastern Europe. Eventually
they were dispersed throughout Russia, Eastern Europe and then through to
western Europe....this group of jews, broadly described as Ashekanazims , can
claim no racial relationship with Palestine. The small minority group of jews,
the Shepardim, have lived in peace and harmony with the arab peoples over
centuries. They are very different from the Ashekanazim jew in many ways,
including appearance.
Donn de Grand Pré, “Barbarians inside the Gates: he Black Book of Bolshevism”:
 - the bulk of the reigning elite of the Bolshevik regime presently in power [in
Israel] there are ' jews who are not jews ', but descendants of a Turko-Asiatic
tribe – the Khazars – who converted in masse to Judaism in the seventh century.
There is not a drop of Semitic blood in their veins.”
 Harold Rosenthal, “The Hidden Tyranny”:
 - "" Anti-Semitism does not signify opposition to Semitism. There is no such
thing. It is an expression we Jews use effectively as a smear word - used to
brand a bigot - anyone who dares to criticize a jew. We use it effectively
against hate- mongers."" It is a term that has only recently been created, and
has little real meaning, since the majority of the people we know as jews are
not Semites.""
******   *******   *******

Theodor Herzl, Father of Zionism, “Complete Diaries”, Vol II, Pag 711, stating
that the area of the Jewish state stretches:

 - “From the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates.”

Rabbi Fischmann, member of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared in his
testimony to the U.N. Special Committee of Enquiry on 9 July 1947:

 - “The promised land extends from the River of Egypt up to the Euphrates, it
includes parts of Syria and Lebanon.”

Israel Shahak, Jewish historian and author, “The Zionist Plan For The Middle
East”, regarding  the “A Strategy For Israel in the Nineteen Eighties” by Oded
Yinon :

 - “The plan operates on two essential premises. To survive, Israel must 1)
become an imperial regional power, and 2) must effect the division of the whole
area into small states by the dissolution of all existing Arab states. Small
here will depend on the ethnic or sectarian composition of each state. [battles
between the Sunni and Shia] Consequently, the Zionist hope is the
sectarian-based states becomes Israel's satellites and , ironically, its source
of moral legitimation. This is not a new idea, nor does it surface for the first
time in Zionist strategic thinking. Indeed, fragmenting all Arab states into
smaller units has been a recurrent theme...They also seek acquiescence in their
designs by the Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and other Arab governments as well as by
the Palestinian people. What they want and what they are planning for is not an
Arab world, but a world of Arab fragments that is ready to succumb to Israeli
hegemony.”

 - “The main danger which Israel, as a 'Jewish State' poses to its own people,
to other jews, and to its neighbours is its ideologically motivated pursuit of
territorial expansion and the inevitable series of wars resulting from this aim.
In 1956, I eagerly swallowed all of Prime Minister Ben Gurion's political and
military reasons for Israel initiating the Suez War, until he pronounced in the
Knesset on the third day of that war, that the real reason for it is 'the
restoration of the Kingdom of David and Solomon' to its Biblical [Old Testament]
borders...The Biblical borders of the land of Israel, 'which rabbinical
authorities interpret as ideally belonging to the Jewish State' include the
following areas: in the south, all of Sinai and a part of northern Egypt up to
the  environs of Cairo; in the east, all of Jordan and a large chunk of Saudi
Arabia, all of Kuwait and a part of Iraq south of the Euphrates; in the north,
all of Lebanon and all of Syria together with a huge part of Turkey [up to Lake
Van]; and in the west, Cyprus...In May of 1993, Ariel Sharon formally proposed
in the Likud Convention that Israel should adopt the 'Biblical borders' concept
as its official policy.”

Ralph Schoenman, American marxist activist, “The Hidden History of Zionism”:

 - “There has never been any component of the zionist movement – from its
nominal 'right' to its self-designed 'left' – which has accepted Palestinian
statehood in any form compatible with self-determination.”

 - “Neo-colonial rule, however, depends, as Oded Yinon makes clear, upon the
dialectical relation between military might and hired hands. Fragmenting the
Arab states  will proceed under the cover of war – whether a blitzrieg attack,
use of a proxy armed forces or covert operations. The ultimate success requires
local leaders who can be  bought or ensnared. Zionists, therefore, have given us
repeatedly not only their Mein Kampf but the evidence that the preservation and
extension of their rule depends on misleaders among the victim people. The
'divide and conquer' schemes of Zionism  and their imperial patron are
unending.”

 - “The 'new' strategy of the 80's is the old imperial dictum of divide and
conquer, which depends for its success upon the securing of corrupt satraps to
do the bidding of an aspiring imperial order.....US and Israeli policy now
turned to arming both sides [Iraq & Iran], drawing out the war as long as
possible, while preventing an Iranian victory.” (they were after Iran's rich oil
reserves, so they provoked this war to weaken Iran)

 - “Israel seeks to take full advantage of the impact of poverty and the
consequent instability of the regimes which must control an alienated
population. In this regard the desire of the Zionists to destabilize the Arab
regimes and fragment their countries, while not unwelcome to the USA, is met by
Pentagon cation as to timing and implementation. There is the constant danger
that the wars and manipulated internal divisions  required by Zionists and US
imperialism to  control the region may unleash a popular uprising, as in Iran –
and now within the West Bank and Gaza.”

 - “Not only must Palestinians be driven out of the West Bank and Gaza, but from
the Galilee and pre-1967 Israel. They are to be scattered as they were in
1948.”    [they also use these tactics of buy/ensnare and divide & conquer in
all countries where they live]

George Knupffer, “The Struggle for World Power”, 1958, had the foresight to
predict that US foreign policy only serves to advance Israel's goals, 'A Greater
Israel':

 - “...we should note that the significance of Israel  and of Jerusalem, the
intended capital of the world, is very great. Now it may seem that the Soviets
are opposed to Zionists conquests and are backing the Arabs. In fact the
communists play their usual role of agent-provocateur, and they give the Arabs
enough arms and encouragement to fight without real hope of victory, thereby
justifying Israeli conquests until they have what they always wanted – the whole
area from the Nile to the Euphrates...But should Israel ever be in real danger
then both the USA and the USSR would come to its rescue, being always in
collusion. The sooner the Arabs understand the facts the better for them. Their
only chance of survival is to work on the lines we propose, while abandoning
policies which, for over fifty years, have brought nothing but defeats.”

early 20th century - the mantras are the same, 'democracy', 'freedom'
 E. Malynski, Polish writer, “La Démocratie Victorieuse”, 1929:
 - “America's entrance in the war [WW1] on the side of the Allies was due to
jewish influence. … Democracy was in danger, and that is the most important
point and indeed the pivot of all contemporary history. The rest is just empty
meaningless phrases, fodder which is thrown to beasts who are being led to the
slaughter-house. … The apparent spontaneity of their enthusiasm for war, which
shook the american people, should not astonish those who know America, or who
lived there for some years before 1914. For at that time thousands and thousands
of non-jewish people, who had nevertheless been intoxicated by a costly and
clever publicity campaign. … the nation which above all others claims to be free
and in sovereign command of its own destiny was brainwashed to the hilt. In 1914
any american would have laughed to scorn the idea that in three years time he
would be struggling and suffering in France for the sake of affairs which had no
connection with those of his own country. And yet, when 1917 came, the same man
enlisted enthusiastically. Every soldier whom we happened to interview and
questioned as to his personal motives for fighting, invariably replied: 'we are
fighting for democracy'. They were one step ahead of their fellow soldiers from
other nations, who went for their own country's sake. It is only when we realize
that France was invaded by hundreds of thousands of inhabitants from
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ollinois, Wyoming, California and
subsequently from Ontario, Manitoba, Rhodesia and New South Wales, whose only
possible motive was to hasten the triumph of democracy, that we begin to
understand something of the power of Israel. The power to stir up a whole nation
of solid, egoistical and utilitarian individuals, and to persuade them that
their greatest privilege is to set out and get themselves killed at the utmost
ends of the earth, with no hope of gain for themselves or their children and
almost without their understanding against or for whom they are fighting or why,
is a simply incredible phenomenon which makes one afraid when one comes to think
about it.”   [this is what international jewry has been doing for ages,
brainwashing entire populations with their owned mainstream media and Hollywood
and their controlled academia]

CHARLATANS FABRICATING MESSAGES FROM GOD
Guys, nowadays there are out these plenty of CHARLATANS fabricating ""messages""
from God, Jesus or Our Lady... But what astonishes me the most is the
gullibility of so many catholics who swallow everything without questioning
anything.
Read this supposed ""message"", as if God would waste His time talking about
""Ukraine"", ""sanctions"", ""Putin"" or even take sides on these diabolical
geopolitical machinations [which by the way, don't have any 'good' side']
Let me paste here a ""message"" sent to me by a facebook friend... 🙄... I
highlighted the bits which are more obvious and frankly, ridiculous... the
language used is purely HUMAN LANGUAGE - these charlatans only mention these
issues after reading them in the independent media... this specific charlatan
wasn't mentioning 'Ukraine' 2 or 3 weeks ago, was he?
""Holy Love Messages""
March 6, 2022
Public
Once again, I (Maureen) see a Great Flame that I have come to know as the Heart
of God the Father. He says: ""Children, I invite you to understand that a grave
responsibility rests upon those who are witnessing this aggression in the
Ukraine. It is a responsibility to come to the aid of the oppressed. Sanctions
are not the immediate solution that is needed. That is like pointing a finger at
Vladimir Putin and saying, ""Naughty, naughty."". What is needed is military
strength to come against these aggressive actions. [🤯 wow, seriously? coming
from 'God'???] I do not propose war. I do propose a show of strength against the
oppressors that tells Russia and the world that this will not be tolerated. Not
to do so, is a sin against humanity.""
""I tell you this as Father of both the aggressors and the oppressed. My Wrath is
mounting in My Heart. Each one's salvation hinges on love of his neighbor. How
is this reflected in such aggression as I witness?""
Read 1 John 4:20-21 +
If anyone says, ""I love God,"" and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who
does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not
seen. And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love
his brother also.
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
I'm lost for words at the levels of gullibility so many catholics fall into!!!
As you could read, this charlatan was also brainwashed with all this ""Ukraine""
media propaganda agenda, this charlatan is also accusing Putin and supporting
Ukraine's ""freedom"" - how pathetic and ridiculous.

WHO OWNS THE MEDIA... AND WHY -

  Protocols of the learned elders of zion, number 2, 5:
 - ""In the hands of the State today there is a great force that creates movement
of thought in the people and this is the Press. The part played by the press is
to keep pointing to our requirements. The Goyim [non-jew] States have not
learned how to make use of this power, and it is now in our hands. Through the
Press we have gained the power to influence others, while remaining ourselves in
the shade.""
Zygmund Dobbs, “The Great Deceit:Social Pseudo Sciences”, 1964:
- “ Socialists have infiltrated our colleges, our schools, our law courts, our
government, our media of communication and our churches. They have done so by
the old Fabian method of infiltration – wolves in sheep's clothing.”
Lonnie Wolfe, “Switch Off Your TV”:
 - “... everything that you see and have seen on television is a result of
decisions by a small elite. This elite controls the major television networks,
the cable channels and the major production studios. This elite is in turn
controlled, both directly and indirectly, by oligarchical banking and financial
interests centered in New York, London and similar financial centers.”
Anton LaVey, leader of the satanic church founded in the 60's, said in 1966:
 - ""Television is the satanic family altar. Television is the major mainstream
infiltration for the new satanic religion.""
Dr Morris Janowitz, Chicago university, December 1st 1984:
 - “ Television has allowed us to create a common culture and without it, we
would not have been able to accomplish our goal.”
Fred Emery, Tavistock Institute staff, “Working Hypotheses on the Psychology of
Television”, 1959:
 - “ The psychological after-effects of television are of considerable interest
to the would-be social engineer.”
Walter Lipmann, Social engineer and one of the most influential of political
commentators, “Public Opinion”, 1922:
 - “ The pictures inside the heads of human beings, the pictures of themselves,
of others, of their needs and purposes, and relationship, are their public
opinions. Those pictures which are acted upon by groups of people, or by
individuals acting in the name of groups, are Public Opinion, with capital
letters. … It is through the media, that most people come to develop those
'pictures in their heads', giving the media an awesome power. … People whose
fame is in turn built up by the media, such as movie stars, can become opinion
leaders , with as much power to sway public opinion as political figures. ...
the mass of absolutely illiterate, of feeble minded, grossly neurotic,
undernourished and frustrated individuals is very considerable, much more
considerable, there is reason to think, than we generally suppose. Thus a wide
popular appeal is circulated among persons who are mentally children or
barbarians, whose lives are a morass of entanglements, people whose vitality is
exhausted, shut-in people, and people whose experience has comprehended no
factor in the problem under discussion.''
 - the whole process of observing, describing, reporting, and then imagining has
been accomplished for you. Without more trouble than is needed to stay awake,
the result which your imagination is always aiming at is reeled off on the
screen. … Popular opinion is ultimately determined by the desires and wishes of
an elite social set. … That set is a powerful, socially superior, successful,
rich urban social set [which] is fundamentally international throughout the
Western Hemisphere and in many ways, London is its center. It counts among its
membership the most influential people in the world, containing as it does the
diplomatic sets, high finance , the upper circles of the army and navy, some
princes of the church, the great newspaper proprietors, their wives, mothers,
and daughters who wield the sceptre of invitation. It is at once a great circle
of talk and a real social set. … coordination of public opinion is lacking in
precision. If the goal of a one-worldist Great Society is to be realized, then
public opinion must be organized for the press, not by the press. … It is not
sufficient to rely on the whims of a super social set to manipulate the pictures
in people's heads; that job can only be managed by a specialized class which
operates through intelligence bureaus.''
Tony Lentz, an assistant professor of speech, “The Medium Is Madness”, observed
at the World Future Society event that he had witnessed destruction of oral and
written skills, by the mass media and television; not only could most students
not write coherently, but they could not even speak intelligently, 1981:
 - “ This was not merely a function of miseducation, but also because they had
no desire to think. … Plato states that our knowledge of the world must be based
on knowing the mind of someone who knows something about it. Television has left
people with the idea that mere images represent knowledge. There is no
questioning, no effort to get inside the mind of someone, merely dialogue and
image, sound and fury, that certainly signify nothing.”
 - “ Allowing ourselves to be influenced by the subtle but powerful illusions
presented by television, leads to a kind of mass madness that can have rather
frightening implications for the future of the nation ... We will have begun to
see things that aren't there, giving someone else the power to make up our
illusions for us. The prospect is frightening, and given our cultural heritage
we should know better.” [characterized this age as 'friendly fascist', 'global
information order']
Hal Becker, social engineer for Tavistock Institute of London, 'Future Groups',
in an interview,1981:
 - “ Americans don't really think - they have opinions, feelings. Television
creates opinion, then validates it. Are they brainwashed by the tube? It is
really more than that. I think that people have lost their ability to relate the
images of their own lives without television intervening. This really is what we
mean when we say we have a wired society. We are headed for an Orwellian
society, but Orwell made a mistake in “1984”. Big Brother doesn't need to watch
you, as long as you watch it. And who can say that this is really so bad?''
 - “ Controlling the world's sources of news , All-Judaan can always prepare the
minds of the people for its next move. The greatest exposure yet to be made it
is the way that news is manufactured and the way in which the mind of whole
nations is moulded for a purpose. When the powerful jew is at last traced and
his hand revealed, then comes the ready cry of persecution and it echoes through
the world press. The real causes of the persecution [which is the oppression of
the people by the financial practices of the jews] are never given publicity.”
Baron Moses Montefiore:
 - “As long as we do not have the press of the whole world in our hands,
everything you do is in vain. We must control or influence the papers of the
whole world in order to blind and deceive the people.”
Thomas Sowell, 1994:
 - “ The barbarians are not at the gates, they are inside the gates – and have
academic tenure, judicial appointments, government grants, and control of the
movies, television, and other media. The question of the hour – and of the next
century – is whether all this can be turned around.”
Z. Brzezinski, when asked about how Trump has a huge influence on many
americans:
 - ""Well, I think that the dangerous, you know, edges here are that he is trying
to undermine the media and trying to make up his own facts. And it could be that
while unemployment and the economy worsens, he could have undermined the
messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think. And
that, that is our job.""
Sir Alexander King, top adviser on science and education policy to the royal
family:
 - “ The media is the most powerful weapon and agent of change in the fight to
establish a one-worldist, neo-Malthusian order that will transcend and
obliterate the concept of the nation-state. … It is certainly necessary to
engage in a broad debate with the journalists and the top media executives
involved to study the conditions for them to be able to define this new role.”
L.G. Pine, British author, ""Tales of the British Aristocracy"", 1956, exposing
how the jews wealth buys power everywhere, and even inter-married with British
aristocracy:
 - "" The power of money is very great and as almost every liberal newspaper is
under jewish influence...10 cases of jewish connection which are now forgotten.
The reason is that in many cases jewish origin is concealed... A man is not
usually thought the more of, because he has married a woman for her money... An
ancient estate is likely to be sold unless some large sums are found. The sums
are found from marriage with a jewish heiress...There can be no question that
the British Peerage is now very much diluted with jewish blood and has many
connections among its most ancient and august families with those who only a few
generations ago were inhabitants of the Ghetto.""
Noam Chomsky, “Media Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda”:
 - “...The issue is whether we want to live in a free society or whether we want
to live under what amounts to a form of self-imposed totalitarianism, with the
bewildered herd marginalized, directed elsewhere, terrified , screaming
patriotic slogans, fearing for their lives and admiring with awe the leader who
saved them from destruction, while the educated classes goose-step on command
and repeat the slogans they're supposed to repeat and the society deteriorate at
home. We end up serving a mercenary enforcer state, hoping that others are going
to pay us to smash up the world...”
Bertrand Russell, “The Impact of Science on Society”, 1953.:
 - ""I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass
psychology.... Its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of
modern methods of propaganda. Of these the most influential is what is called
'education'. Religion plays a part, though a diminishing one; the press, the
cinema , and the radio play an increasing part...”
Walter Conkite, Jew:
 - “Our [media personnel] task is not to tell the truth; we are opinion
moulders.”
Samuel Roth, American Jewish author and publisher, “Jews Must Live”:
 - “The easiest business for the young jew not apt enough to enter one of the
major professions, is selling newspapers. Almost all the news stands in America
are owned by Jews.”

Subject: March 3
In catholic nations, mother's day and father's day is on the 1st sunday of May
[Mary's month] and on 19th of March [feast of St Joseph] respectively. In
non-catholic countries these two feast days were distorted... most probably to
undermine the genuine feast days!!!
One of the biggest signs of these end times is how satanist is out in the open,
and how they're conditioning children with movies, songs, cartoons, book

{p. 2} Imprimatur..

Jose Maria Cardenal Caro y Rodriguez

Arzobispo de Santiago of Chile

First Published 1925
Revised Second Edition 1957

{p. 3} FOREWORD

The Book of His Eminence, the Most Reverend Cardinal Caro y Rodriguez,
Archbishop of Santiago, Chile, has been highly approved in various countries. For
this reason we present to the public a new edition.

We have no doubt but that this one will be equally well received, because of its
controversial theme, the necessity for its being divulged in the period of disorientation and
confusion, and the concise and penetrating manner in which the subject is presented.

We feel grateful for the encouragement which has come from His Eminence, Cardinal
Rodriquez in granting his gracious permission for this new edition.

These are our reasons and our sentiments. The public will be the judge of our efforts.

The Editors (1957)

{p. 5} PROLOGUE TO THE SECOND EDITION

The rapidity with which the first edition of this work was exhausted, in spite of its large
number, has proved clearly that its publication was opportune and that it met a real need.

Without exception those who have read it have altered their decision to become Masons.
Many have thanked me for having opened their eyes about an institution which had been
recommended to them, and many more have congratulated me for having brought into
the open an association feared for its secrets and its intrigues. Among these have been
some of the most outstanding personalities of our country.

Especially encouraging to me have been the letters received from Archbishops and
Bishops of Latin America and also of the Philippines which were not only complimentary
but carried frank and effusive expressions of approval. Many have asked for copies of this
little book in spite of its modest presentation. Among the good wishes I have received I
wish particularly to acknowledge those from the Cardinals to whom the work had been
sent, namely, their Eminences Cardinal Benlloch and Cardinal Billot.
I have introduced in this second edition some improvements and additions. I have
arranged in the index the divisions, changing in part the titles of the paragraphs, adjusting
them better to the order of the book, and made one or two indispensable corrections.

The study of Masonry which I have endeavored to continue pursuing has but confirmed
the ideas I had expressed in the first edition. Moreover, conversations which I have had
with Masons have but strengthened my own convictions.

While congratulating me on this little work, several people have wished to corroborate
with concrete facts the judgment which I has expressed. I shall refrain from publishing
their communications because there are still living ""brother Masons,""whose names are
mentioned as having participated in deeds and activities which can be accounted as
transgressions of the law. it is preferable to allow each reader to substantiate for himself
his observations of people and their actions that come within the circle of his own
experience, never forgetting what I so frequently repeat, namely that in Masonry there are
serious and sincere persons who are unaware of its objectives or of its works and who are
not regulating their lives according to the influence of the Masonic doctrine and spirit.

{p. 6} Masonry has also judged my book, and the ""brothers"" repeat the opinion which was
published in their Revista. According to the ""brothers"" I have ""collected all the mire of the
anti-masonic sewer, and with broken or apocryphal references, with repetition of concepts
of four enraged and despicable hirelings which the clergy has had for its use and
pleasure, attempted to discredit the holy work of love of neighbor which Masonry spreads
everywhere.""

Furthermore, the above mentioned Revista adds that because I availed myself of the free
postage enjoyed by church dignitaries, the pamphlet has been distributed postage free
throughout the country.

My reply will be brief: In the first place, the booklet was published in Santiago and
distributed from there by the Society of the Good Press, which is not an ecclesiastical
institution and which is not granted free postage. The copies which were sent me at
Iquique, arrived with the required postage attached.

Secondly, if I have not quoted completely all the testimonies which I have examined, it
has been in order to avoid making this work much longer than necessary or more lengthy
than I had planned, even though I may have wished to extend it. I have always pointed
out the source of my references with great precision, contrary to the Masonic publications
which almost never do.

Thirdly, the references either are taken from Masonic authors of recognized authority in
the Order, or else refer to historic deeds in which the ""brothers"" or the Masonic influence
have taken part; if there is anything repugnant in all this, it is not due to me or to the
enemies of Masonry, but rather because of its own actions and doctrines.

Someone has advanced the statement that I failed to prove what I said of Masonry.
Readers will say whether there is sufficient proof of the general affirmation, which is here
made concerning the universal deception through which Masonry gains and holds its
initiates, and indoctrinates deeply and at times forcibly regarding their real plans for the
destruction of the Christian order, and the banishment of the very name of Christ, and
even of God, all of which is proposed either openly or covertly, according to
circumstances. 'Me readers will also tell whether or not what they see and know Of
Masonry and its works corroborates my statements.

And as for political intervention of Masonry and its anti-Christian spirit, the events which in
Chile preceded and surrounded the elections of 1924, such as the use made of the Army
to mock and defy the popular will, the violation of pacts of honor, the irritant pressure
exercised over the Head of

{p. 7} the Government to sidetrack and degrade him, the development of the insufferable
atmosphere which burst forth in the confusion and agitation of the scourge initiated by the
Army and Navy supposedly for the defense of the national interests, evinced almost
universal sympathy; but all this was followed by anti-religious plans concerning divorce,
the confiscation of Church property, the separation of Church and State, etc. All those
measures proved to the country the duplicity of the statements made by Masonry.

Moreover, Masons have said that it is very easy for them to destroy what this book
established. Nevertheless, they have not as yet, in spite of having had more than enough
time to do so. What they have done is to pursue their campaign against the Catholic
Church, with the anonymous tract La Tribuna consisting of vague references, impossible
to prove, and with the usual statements, based neither on logic nor on truth, but rather on
prejudice against Christianity.
I have been asked if Masonry has taken revenge on me, and of course, there are readers
who will be very curious to know this. Masonry is decreet enough to act by itself, and if
revenge took place it would lose instead of gaining. But it wears the mask of a political
party by means of which it exercises all the actions which the influence of that party
allows it to use. Those who have lived in Iquique, and perhaps even the inhabitants of the
whole.country, have come to know something of what has been done. For instance, on
the occasion of the coming of His Eminence Cardinal Benlloch, or of the Eucharistic
Congress which we were going to hold in the Municipal Theater. Whatever there may
have been in it of personal offence, I forgive, and overlook with all my heart. For what
there has been of offense to religion, I ask God to pardon also, because, ""they know not
what they do..""

Finally since this book has no other pretension but to inform its readers about Masonry, I
have thought it better to do it with the words of authoritative than I {sic}, even though it
increased the number of references.

This documentary is about the most horrific crimes of the synagogueo f satan in
the history of the world - jewish ritual murder - for centuries that jews kidnap
a small christian boy to torture, blood out and kill him; this is a satanic
ritual at the time of the 'passover' of judaism/pharisaism. No, it's not 'blood
libel' nor 'antisemitism'; the jewish encyclopedia admits up to 123 of these
cases until the beginning of the 20th century, all cases they couldn't possibly
deny since they were all investigated directly by kings, quens and princes...
during the 20th century they refined this ritual, using abortion mills... and
all those evil networks which kidnap kids annually:
The History of Blood Libel (bitchute.com)
Bernard Lazare, French Jewish literacy critic, political journalist, polemicist
and anarchist, “L'Anti-semitism”, pag.215:
 - ""To this general belief are added the suspicions, often justified, against
the jews addicted tomagical practices. Actually, in the Middle Ages, the jew was
considered by the people as the magician par excellence; one finds many formulae
of exorcism in the [Babylonian] Talmud, and the Talmudic and Cabbalistic
demonology is very complicated. Now, one knows the position that blood always
occupies in the operation of sorcery. In Chaldean magic it had a very great
importance. . . Now it is very probable, even certain, that jewish magicians
must have sacrificed children; hence the origin of the legend of ritual
sacrifice.""
Charles Weisman, Jewish author, “Who is Esau-Edom?”:
 - “ During the middle ages jews were found guilty of ritual murder of
Christians in England; in Norwich in 1146, and Lincoln in 1225; in France at
Blois in 1171 and northern Italy at Trent in 1475. The jewish encyclopedia lists
121 ritual murder cases from 1146 to 1900, which were tried in courts. Many of
the listings show convictions and the mode in which guilty jews were
executed...From 1900 to 1939 there have been about another 20 cases of ritual
murder by jews. Even to this day there are reports of ritual murder of children
by certain extremists Hasidic Orthodox jewish sects. Abortion has become an
overt means of child sacrifice which jews have instituted under their de facto
law. A more covert of child sacrifice has been by their infamous 'ritual
murderers', which jews have been accused through the ages. In this practice, the
blood of the sacrificed gentile is mixed with flour to make unleavened bread
eaten at Passover. Even God commanded circumcision, there is no way a reading of
Scripture shows that God intended that the procedure turn into a bloody ritual.
Besides that, it seems apparent that when Christ nailed the blood ordinances to
the Cross, He also nailed the circumcision to the Cross. “Behold, I Paul say
unto you, that if ye' be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.”
  Father Alban Butler, “Lives of the Saints”:
 -  "" In the year 1472, when the jews of Trent met in their synagogue on Tuesday
in Holy Week, to deliberate preparations for the approaching festival of the
Passover, which fell that year on thursday following, they came to a resolution
of sacrificing to their inveterate hatred of the Christian name, some Christian
infant on the Friday following, or Good Friday. A jewish physician undertook to
procure such an infant for the horrid purpose. [note that these rituals were not
performed by the jewish pleb, but by the elites] And while the Christians were
at the office of Tenebrae on Wednesday evening, he found a child called Simon,
about two years old, whom by caresses and by showing him a piece of money, he
decoyed from the door of a house, the master and mistress whereof had gone off
to Church, and carried him off. On thursday evening the principal jews shut
themselves up in a chamber adjoining to their synagogue, and at midnight began
their cruel butchery of this innocent victim. (Ed . note, Did not Christ say to
the jews, 'This is your hour, and the power of darkness'). Having stopped his
mouth with an apron to prevent his crying out, they made several incisions in
his body, gathering his blood in a basin. Some all this while, held his arms
stretched out in the form of a cross; others held his legs. The child being half
dead, they raised him to his feet, and while two of them held him by the arms,
the rest pierced his body on all sides with their awls and bodkins. When they
saw the child had expired, they sung round it: 'In the same manner did we treat
Jesus the God of the Christians ;thus may our enemies be confounded forever.'
The magistrates and parents making strict search after the lost child, the Jews
hid it first in a barn of hay, then in a cellar, and at last threw it into a
river (note: jews find gentiles to be no humans, but animals, therefore they
don't bury humans). But God confounded all their endeavours to prevent the
discovery of the fact, which being proved upon them, with its several
circumstances, they were put to death, the principal actors in the tragedy being
broken upon the wheel and burnt. The synagogue was destroyed, and a chapel was
erected upon the spot where the child was martyred. God honoured this innocent
victim with many miracles. The relics lie in a stately tomb in St. Peter's
Church at Trent; and the name occurs in the Martyrology.""   [they've done this
throughout the centuries, right until today]
Father James E . Bulger, “Live of the saints”:
 - ""The blood lust of the jews and their hatred of Jesus Christ are combined in
this horrible ceremony...each of us must ask himself, What kind of Christian,
what kind of human being, am I, if I do nothing to protect children from such
horrible sacrifice in a supposedly Christian and modern society?
Rabbi Harry Waton:
 - “The murder of goys (non-jews cattle, beasts) and the drinking of their blood
increases the holiness of Israel.”
Elizabeth Dilling, christian wife of the US ambassador to Russia at the time of
the jewish Russian Revolution, “The Jewish Religion: Its Influence Today”, 1983,
pag.54:
 - “ Burning children to the demon Moloch is permitted today by the supreme
legal authority of the so-called ' Jewish Religion ', which is the Babylonian
Talmud (note: whore of babylon), and, in particular, the Talmud book of
Sanhedrin, Folios 64a-64b.”
Rabbi Dresner:
 - “ Jews have played a less than admirable role in the sexual revolution. Many
liberal rabbis are in the forefront of the pro-abortion movement. In fact,
survey indicates that jewish women are among the most likely of all groups to
support abortion on demand.”
Aleister Crowley, Cabalist/satanist, coined the motto, 'Thou what shall wilt
shall be the whole of the law' which was prominent in the entire music 60's
revolution, the Golden Dawn:
 - The blood is the life. This simple statement is explained by the Hindus by
saying that the blood is the principal vehicle of vital Prana...It was the
theory of the ancient Magicians, that any living being is a storehouse of energy
varying in quantity according to the size and health of the animal, and in
quality according to its mental and moral character. At the death of the animal
this energy is liberated suddenly . [For magical purposes.] The animal should
therefore be killed within the Circle, or the Triangle, as the case may be, so
that its energy cannot escape . An animal should be selected whose nature
accords with that of the ceremony. . . . For the highest spiritual working one
must accordingly choose that victim which contains the greatest and purest
force. A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most
satisfactory and suitable victim... Those magicians who object to the use of
blood have endeavoured to replace it with incense. . . . But the bloody
sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more efficacious; and for nearly all
purposes human sacrifice is the best. The truly great Magician will be able to
use his own blood, or possibly that of a disciple, and that without sacrificing
the physical life irrevocably.""
Dr. C. Burns, “Masonic and Occult Symbols”, p. 28:
 - ""Masons .. admire the Druids and some of them even claim that Masonry came
from Druidism. Of course, the Druids were occultic priests, practiced astrology,
and offered human sacrifices.""
*****   *****   *****   *****   *****
Remember that to expose, warn, instruct and criticize is not the same as to
hate... our duty as christians is to alert other christians about the dangers of
this world...
St. Chrysostom:
 - "" Our sheep, are surrounded by jewish wolves, avoid them; avoid their
impiety; it is not significant controversies that separate us from them, but the
death of Christ. If you think that Judaism is true, leave the Church; if not,
quit Judaism.”
Pope Pius V, explained his expulsion of the Jews from the Papal States in 1569:
 - "" They seduce a great many imprudent and weak persons with their satanic
illusions, their fortune-telling, their charms and magic tricks and witcheries,
and make them believe that the future can be foretold, that stolen goods and
hidden treasures can be recovered, and much else can be revealed.""
St Maximilian Kolbe, “The Poor Ones”:
 - “Man was redeemed, and Christ founded His Church upon a rock. Some of the
Hebrew people recognized Him as the Messiah, but others – among them principally
the Pharisees – did not want to recognize Him. Instead, they persecuted His
followers and issued numerous laws obliging the jews to persecute the
Christians. These laws, together with stories and appendixes, became their
sacred book called The Talmud around the year 500.
 - “ In this book Christians are called idolaters, worse than Turks, murderers,
impure libertines; they are manure, animals in human form, worse than animals,
children of the Devil, etc. Catholic priests are called fortune-tellers and
bald-headed dunces…the Church is called a house of stupidity and filth; sacred
statues, medals and rosaries are called idols. In The Talmud Sundays and holy
days of obligation are considered days of perdition. This book teaches, among
other things, that a Hebrew can deceive a Christian and steal from him since all
the properties of a Christian are – from the text itself – ‘like the desert, the
first to take them becomes the owner.
 “ This book, written in 12 volumes and breathing hatred against Christ, is
considered by these Pharisees a sacred book, more important than Sacred
Scriptures.”
Pope Leo XIII, quoting Monsignor Leon Merin, “Clarification of Freemasonry”:
 - “ The jews are the founders, organizers and leaders of freemasonry, which
they use to attain world domination in order to destroy the holy catholic church
and the remaining existing religions... The aim of Freemasonry is “to exercise
an occult overlordship upon society; [its] sole raison d’etre is to wage war
against God and His church.”
Monsignor Meurin, archbishop of Port Louis, Mauritius:
 - “ Freemasonry is fundamentally jewish, exclusively jewish, passionately
jewish, from the beginning to the end... someday history will tell how all the
revolutions of recent centuries originated in the Masonic sect under the supreme
command of the jews.... the Masons of the 33rd degree were the leaders of the
conspiracy.... the protocols are signed by the representatives of Zion, of the
33rd degree.”
Rev. S.J. Deschamps, “Les Sociétés Secrètes et la Société”, p. 24:
 - "" Judaism itself is a kind of Freemasonry, owing to the national solidarity
of the jews, their cosmopolitanism, which set the jews free from all local and
patriotic ties, and finally, the opposition of the jews to Christianity...
Gnosticism, Manichaeanism, the Albigensians and the Templars — these are the
sources whence Freemasonry has sprung... Jewish influences were active among
these heresies.""
 Cardinal Caro y Rodriguez, of Chile:
 - “It is beyond doubt that the activity of freemasonry against the catholic
church is only a continuation of the war against Christ that has been waged by
Jewry for 1900 years, naturally adjusted to the situation of the Christian
world, by which the former has to conduct itself by means of secrecy, cheating
and sanctimoniousness.”
Bishop Gfoellner of Linz, Pastoral Letter, January 21, 1933:
 - “ Degenerate Judaism with Freemasonry is the carrier of mammoth capitalism.
To fight the evil influence of Judaism is not only the privilege but the duty of
every good Christian... A dam should be erected against spiritual dirt and
immorality which threatens the world from the jews.”
Abbe Joseph Lemann, converted jew, from the classic “Lemann Family”:
 - “ The origin of these occult societies is the Cabal – a hebrew word meaning
'received tradition'. From the time of Moses to the time of Christ, the cabal
had existed as the oral but secret custodian of the most sublime truths of the
hebraic religion. It was the philosophy of the hebrews. But at the dispersion it
turned from wine to vinegar, and passed either into a shadowy realm of vain
speculations, or occupied itself with magic, terrible vows and sinister symbols
and the operations of a hateful conspiracy against the Christian religion. It
was the father of sorcery, astrology, alchemy and of all the false sciences of
the middle ages. This science cabalistic, abstruse on it's speculative side, bad
and wicked on it's practical side, was known only to a small number of Israel.”

Father Andrew O'Brien, “Make Yourself an Ark”, pag.75:
 - “The more the nations were seduced by lucifer, the more their inhabitants
sank into the dreadful mire generated through pagan fertility rites and phallic
worship, core ingredients of the jewish cabal and the gnosticism of freemasonry!
As the freemason Rason once wrote: ' the cabala is the key to the occult
sciences, the gnostics were born of the cabalists...The jewish cabala is a
library of literature dealing with magic , spiritism and based on sheer
pantheism. It proclaims a non-existence of evil, and a deitification of man, and
all this points to the cabala as the source of many modern “isms”. According to
the american freemason, Dr. Mackey in the lexicon of freemasonry there was
besides the divine cabala of the children of Seth, the magical cabala of the
children of Cain. Out of the evil cabala of Cain grew the Babylonian Talmud.”
[the Babylonian Talmud is the 'sacred' book of Judaism/pharisaism; judaism has
zero to to with the ancient Mosaic Law, instead it's pharisaism passed down
through generations until today]
La Civilta Cattolica, official publication of the Vatican, 1890:
 - "" Once having acquired absolute civil liberty and equality in every sphere
with Christians and the nations, the dam which previously had held back the
Hebrews was opened for them, and in short time, like a devastating torrent, they
penetrated and cunningly took over everything: gold, trade, the stock market,
the highest appointments in political administrations, in the army and in
diplomacy; public education , the press, everything fell into their hands or
into the hands of those who were inevitably depending upon them.”
 - “ The people crying ""hate"" in fact are the real haters. They aim for ""the
extermination of Christian civilization""... The Talmud views all non-Jews as
subhuman, i.e. beasts. Talmudic Jews see themselves as ""the highest race of
mankind"" entitled to ""lay claim to all the wealth of the universe... Their
Messiah must be ""a great conqueror who puts the nations under the yoke of the
Jews.""
 - “The Talmud ""teaches that an Israelite is more pleasing to God than the
angels of paradise; that to strike a jew is to strike God...""
 - “How to defend Christian civilization when all social institutions --
government, media, education and the economy-- have been taken over by
the jewish bankers and their Freemason agents?'
 - “Jewish wealth should be confiscated: ""It is absolutely legitimate...for the
plundered nation to recover the ill gotten gains from the thieves... Gold is the
most powerful weapon by which the jews exterminate religion and oppress the
people ...one has at least the right to seize this weapon from them.""
 - “... not all Hebrews are ""thieves, cheats, usurers, Freemasons, cads and
corrupters of customs... a certain number are not complicit in the trickeries of
the others. How could these innocents be ""included in the punishment?... Even
supposing that the remedy of universal banishment of the Hebrews was feasible
now, it would not accord with the Roman Church's way of thinking and acting...
Heaven's chosen instrument for punishing the degenerate Christianity of our time
is the Hebrews. Europe will become one single huge plantation exploited by the
jews through the labour and sweat of the Christians reduced to slavery.""
[this quote starts mentioning that the 1000 year period of relative peace had
ended once the jews again started having influence in society; it started in
Italy with the Renaissance, then they supported and financed the Reformation,
the then Enlighnenment, the french revolution, russian revolution, the two world
wars, 9/11 and so on... that period of 1000 years of peace lasted from the end
of the 5th century, when the roman persecutions ended and the Church could
expand freely and build civilization, until late 15th century with the
Renaissance... late 15th century",,,,,,,,,,

     New Food System Will Stop at Nothing to Control You
                Analysis by Dr. Joseph Mercola       Fact Checked        May 19, 2022

   STORY AT-A-GLANCE
    The globalist takeover is coming at us from every possible angle. Whether we’re talking
     about biosecurity, finance, housing, health care, energy, transportation or food, all the
     changes we’re now seeing have one goal, and that is to force compliance with a
     totalitarian slave system

    The global food system, and protein sources in particular, are currently under coordinated
     and intentional attacks to manufacture food shortages and famine

    The globalist elite intend to eliminate traditional farming and livestock and replace it with
     indoor-grown produce and lab-created protein alternatives that they own and control

    While the presence of hundreds of food brands gives the appearance of market
     competition, the reality is that the food industry is monopolized by fewer than a dozen
     companies, and all of them, in turn, are largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard

    Eventually, your ability to buy food will be tied to your digital identity and social credit
     score

The globalist takeover agenda is nothing if not comprehensive. They’re coming at us
from every possible angle, and whether we’re talking about biosecurity, finance,
housing,1 health care, energy, transportation or food, all the changes we’re now seeing
have one goal, and that is to force compliance with a totalitarian slave system.

In an April 27, 2022, blog post,2 investigative journalist Corey Lynn takes a deep dive into
the new food system being put into place, and how it is geared to control you.
   “‘Who controls the food supply controls the people; who controls the energy can
   control whole continents; who controls money can control the world.’ This
   famous quote by Henry Kissinger is ringing more and more true by the week,”
   Lynn writes.3

   “The globalists already control the majority of the money, are moving ever so
   swiftly to convert the energy system over into systems they are all invested in,
   and have been taking drastic measures to control the food industry while
   running much of it under the radar. If they control the seeds they control the
   food, and if they control the food they can use the digital ID to control consumer
   access to the food.

   While a rash of fires suddenly destroy food processing, meat, and fertilizer
   plants, during a time where farmers are hurting and supply chain issues are
   kicking in, an entire traceable food infrastructure system has already been built
   in multiple cities and is making its way across the globe ...

   The USDA and FDA have already approved lab grown meat, genetically modified
   cattle, and are funding the globalists to research and develop cellular
   agriculture as well as indoor growers and genetics companies ...

   Union Pacific is mandating railroad shipping reductions by 20% impacting CF
   Industries Holdings, the world’s largest fertilizer company. Vanguard, BlackRock
   and State Street happen to be the top shareholders of Union Pacific, and
   BlackRock and Vanguard are in the top three shareholders of CF Industries
   Holdings.

   By mapping some of the largest vertical farms, it reveals the crops, grocery
   stores involved, locations and billions pouring in by globalist investors and
   shareholders. It quickly becomes evident that this is the global plan to control
   all produce — ingredients that go into all food products.”

The Secret Monopoly
As noted by Lynn, this monopoly has been locked into place over the course of many
years. Slowly but surely, the monopoly has grown, under the radar of public
consciousness, which in turn has resulted in food getting simultaneously more
expensive and less accessible.4

Now, as the final pieces are being put into place, many are waking up to the realization
that we’ve been massively fooled and are now at the mercy of a figurative “handful” of
unelected people whose megalomania is unsurpassed in human history.

    “ Combined, the three largest investment firms in the
    world, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have
    ownership in nearly 90% of all S&P 500 firms.
    Through their investment holdings they secretly wield
    monopoly control over ALL industries, so the idea that
    there is competition anywhere in the marketplace is
    really just a clever illusion.
                                              ”
While the presence of hundreds of food brands gives the appearance of market
competition, the reality is that the food industry is monopolized by fewer than a dozen
companies,5 and all of them, in turn, are largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard. The
growing fake meat market is similarly dominated by a very small number of large food
giants6 which, again, are owned by BlackRock and Vanguard.

BlackRock alone holds $10 trillion in assets,7 up from $6 trillion in 2017.8 Combined, the
three largest investment firms in the world, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have
ownership in nearly 90% of all S&P 500 firms.9

Through their investment holdings they secretly wield monopoly control over ALL
industries, so the idea that there is competition anywhere in the marketplace is really
just an illusion. You never learned about their ever-expanding monopoly because they
also own the centralized media.
It’s hard to tell which of the two is more influential. Vanguard owns a large share of
Blackrock. Owners and stockholders of Vanguard include Rothschild Investment Corp,10
Edmond De Rothschild Holding,11 the Italian Orsini family, the American Bush family, the
British Royal family, the du Pont family, and the Morgan, Vanderbilt and Rockefeller
families.12,13

Blackrock, meanwhile, has been called the ""fourth branch of government,"" as they are
the only private firm that has financial agreements to lend money to the central banking
system.14

Food Security Is Undermined by Patentable Food

In 2014, the U.S. Congress established the Foundation for Food and Agriculture
Research Act (FFAR) through the Farm Bill. After siphoning off $200 million in taxpayer
funds to get the foundation started, FFAR became a nongovernmental not-for-profit
organization. Bill Gates is one of its funders, and its first board of directors included
deputy director Dr. Robert Horsch of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.15

The mission of FFAR is to “connect funders, researchers and farmers through public-
private partnerships to support audacious research addressing the biggest food and
agriculture challenges.”16 In reality, it’s been used to undermine food security by
increasing reliance on gene-edited and patentable foods.

In April 2019, FFAR launched the Precision Indoor Plants (PIP) Consortium, a public-
private partnership of indoor growers, breeders and genetics companies with the shared
goal of advancing speed-breeding and altering plant chemicals responsible for flavor,
nutrition and medicinal value. Five key crops being worked on are lettuce, tomatoes,
strawberries, cilantro and blueberries.

In August 2020, Monsanto/Bayer helped found a startup called Unfold, which develops
new vegetable seed varieties specifically geared for vertical farms. According to Lynn,
“GMOs already account for 75 to 80% of food Americans consume,”17 and once fresh
produce is under patent, that percentage will inch closer to 100%.
The University of California is also working on plant-based mRNA vaccines. The idea
there is to disseminate vaccines through the conventional food supply,18 which puts a
whole new spin on the old adage to “Let thy food be thy medicine.”

    “Bill Gates insists that droughts and climate change is destroying our ability to
    farm and that the future will consist of populations moving into metropolitan
    cities where indoor vertical farming is necessary to feed people.

    If this is the case, why has he acquired 242,000 acres of farmland over the past
    decade while simultaneously investing in indoor vertical farming? Who gets to
    sit at the table with healthy produce served up by Gates while the rest of the
    population eats gene-edited produce from locked-down facilities, delivered to
    their local grocery store, and accessed only through a digital ID?” Lynn asks.19

    “Meanwhile, the Consultative Group of International Agriculture Research
    (CGIAR) holds the world’s largest private seed banks consisting of 10% of the
    worldwide germplasm across the globe, which is controlled by the Bill &
    Melinda Gates Foundation, Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and World Bank,
    managing 768,576 accessions of hijacked farmers seeds ...

    [W]hat’s going to happen to the farmers when these astronomically enormous
    indoor vertical farm facilities have taken over every major city, locked in
    contracts with all major grocery store chains, and are funded by some of the
    same billionaire globalists who are seeking to control human beings through
    every industry for their fourth industrial revolution?

    It’s a legitimate concern. Add ‘gene-editing,’ ‘smart,’ ‘traceable,’ and ‘net zero’ to
    the production of these facilities, and the fact that they are still moving full
    speed ahead on digital IDs and currency, and it becomes even more concerning
    ...

    Whereas this provides a lot of explanation on the absolute intentional
    demolition to all of our farmers on the seed, vegetable, and produce front,
     people should also be aware of what’s been taking place with cattle ranchers
     and the globalists’ plan to take over the meat industry as well.”

Controlled Demolition of the Protein Supply Is Underway

As I explained in yesterday’s weaponized bird flu article, alleged outbreaks of bird flu
and COVID-19 in food animals, along with drought and fertilizer shortages, have led to
the mass culling of flocks20 and cattle herds21 around the world. So much so, we’re now
told to expect egg,22 poultry and meat shortages.23

Add to that a global fertilizer shortage that is limiting the amount of animal feed that
can be produced this year, and the curious decision to limit U.S. fertilizer shipments on
trains, which restricts distribution and raises the cost of what little remains. Experts
predict it may take up to three years to replenish global grain stocks,24 and in the
meantime, farmers won’t have a readily available supply to feed their livestock.

Canada-based Nutrien Ltd., the world’s largest fertilizer company, recently warned the
shortage is likely to extend into 2023. The price of fertilizer has also “skyrocketed to
absurd heights that have never been seen before,” The Economic Collapse Blog
reports.25

The U.S. and U.K. are also paying farmers to not farm all their available land, California
is paying farmers to grow less, ostensibly to save water, and the U.K. is encouraging
farmers to retire by offering them a lump sum of £100,000 — all while publicly predicting
looming food shortages.26 On top of that, the two largest water reservoirs in California
have also fallen to “critically low levels” and wildfires are devastating agricultural land
across the western half of the U.S.27

Food production is being blatantly attacked and irrationally restricted on so many fronts,
it’s clearly an intentional demolition of primary protein sources28 — meat, egg and dairy.

     “February 1, 2016 the Good Food Institute was launched ... with funding from
     the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Open Philanthropy Project, and Y
     Combinator, with the goal to ‘reimagine meat production,’” Lynn writes.29
     “In October 2021, the Good Food Institute celebrated the USDA’s $10 million
     grant for the creation of the first-ever National Institute for Cellular Agriculture
     at Tufts University so they can back researchers in manufactured meat.

     To be certain all of these goals are locked into place and the UN 2030 agenda is
     achieved, disrupting the fertilizer industry, food supply chain, and a rash of
     coincidental fires to food processing plants sure would help to seal the deal,
     wouldn’t it?”

The Emperor Has No Clothes

In a blatantly self-serving gesture, Gates has publicly called for the West to quit eating
beef and transition to lab-grown meats, ostensibly to address climate change. He’s also
railed against legislative attempts to make sure fake meats are properly labeled, since
labeling would slow down public acceptance.30

Not surprisingly, Gates is financially invested in several faux meat companies.31,32,33 As
luck or godlike foresight would have it, he’s also invested in genetically engineered
fertilizer alternatives.34 Lynn writes:35

     “Bill Gates explained his love for fertilizer in 2018 while in Tanzania.36
     Coincidentally, Gates-led and Rockefeller-funded Alliance for a Green
     Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has been an epic fail, with a first ever evaluation
     report37 that came out on February 28, 2022 after a 15-year effort with bold
     claims to rescue Africa’s small farmers.

     Their false promise to ‘double yields and incomes for 30 million farming
     households by 2020’ was removed from their website in June 2020 after an
     assessment by Tufts University revealed little evidence of progress, and in fact
     showed a 31% increase in hunger.

     Evaluators stated there were many deficiencies and AGRA’s reporting and
     monitoring data was weak. Even the German government is considering pulling
     funding from AGRA over their pesticide use, which is ironic because Gates
claims we need to remove pesticides in the U.S. and move to indoor vertical
farming ...

One of AGRA’s biggest achievements was their participation in 72 agricultural
policy reforms in 11 African countries, pertaining to seed, fertilizer and market
access. Laws were created to protect intellectual property rights for ‘certified’
seeds, as penalties were created for open-source seed sharing.

Imagine being a farmer, homesteader or gardener and having to share and trade
seeds on the black market so you don’t get penalized. Anyone who believes they
won’t try this in the U.S. is kidding themselves, especially since the globalists
hold the largest private seeds banks, and invest in the largest commercial seed
companies ...

On March 17, 2022, a notice was published38 to the U.S. Federal Register
seeking comments by May 16, 2022 on Competition and Intellectual Property
System: Seeds and Other Agricultural Inputs. Remember to read through the
proper lens when reviewing this notice that derived from an executive order
signed by Biden in July, 2021 on promoting competition in the American
economy.

Their ultimate goal — every human being, every piece of food, resource, and
product on this planet will be tracked and traced via blockchain. This isn’t a
theory — it is their goal. In July, 2021, the FDA released their ‘New Era of
Smarter Food Safety’ which consists of using tech-enabled traceability for a
digital, traceable food system, from farm to plate using blockchain.

A digital identity to grant access to establishments, control financial spending,
and trace everyone’s moves has been rolling out on multiple fronts, including
the vaccine ID passport. Eventually they will try to move toward a chip, as it will
be easier with biometrics being installed everywhere ...

There is no way to sugarcoat this system they are implementing. Whereas
vertical farming is brilliant in many ways, and could be beneficial on a smaller
       scale in communities, the fact that this is the global agenda to remove farms
       and control all produce by the globalists themselves, makes is incredibly
       concerning ...

       We must work together to find a way forward and continue to say no to the
       digital ID they are creating to control our access and spending, while building
       self sufficiency and security together.”

For solutions to this rapidly approaching dystopian future, review my previous article,
“Why Food Prices Are Expected to Skyrocket,” and Lynn’s article “Finding Sources of
Fresh Food.”39

Part of the answer is to grow your own food, to the best of your ability. Another part is to
support local growers by buying their produce, or else they’ll get pushed out. Starting
local co-ops and community gardens can also go a long way toward creating food
security in the long term.

At the same time, we also have to reject globalist solutions like fake meat, gene-edited
beef, GMO foods and all the rest of it. It’s time to recognize that none of their solutions
are for our benefit. They’re for our detriment. The World Economic Forum has declared
that by 2030, you will own nothing. They mean it. They will take everything from us,
including the right to grow our own food, if we let them.

FREEMASONRY: FOUNDATION OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION - Fr Dennis Fahey
Researched and Compiled by Pauly Fongemie for Catholic Tradition
Based on american catholic scholar Solange Hertz book ""The Star Spangled Heresy:
Americanism""

PART 1: THE UNITED STATES OF SATAN v. THE AMERICA OF GOD

In her eminent work, THE STAR-SPANGLED HERESY: AMERICANISM, Catholic author and
historian, Solange Hertz, writes [text in green]:

[Note that I do not have a contact address for the author and thus was unable to
begin the obtaining of permission to use the several pages that are most
pertinent here. However, under the US Code, there exists the ""fair use law""
whereby I am permitted to quote brief passages as long as I cite the author and
work. Because I am using pages 1-42, this necessitates that I eclipse whole
passages in order to maintain the requirements of brevity. I trust that the
portion cited will be lucid to the reader. This indispensable book, linked above
in bold is a bargain at 13.00. The ""fair use law"" permission has been used
elsewhere in this presentation.]

""The Immaculate Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to . . . Juan Diego in the Spanish
west in 1531 and promised to destroy the cult of the serpent there, the ancient
dragon had nowhere to go but east, where he found more hospitable quarters among
usurpers and heretics. Settling incognito in spots like his famous Green Dragon
Tavern in Boston, he was free to get on with his Revolution with the help of Ben
Franklin . . . He was incognito . . . only to the ignorant . . . he was quickly
recognized by those in the know . . . From the beginning this old serpent was
rightly named Lucifer, the 'Light-Bearer,' for he is the source of the 'false
light' which the Blessed Virgin told us at La Salette would soon 'illumine the
world,' causing 'extraordinary wonders every place because the true faith will
be extinguished.'

. . . The light the serpent offers can only be the light of his own tremendous
natural knowledge, for he is forever cutoff from the supernatural . . . Satanic
natural knowledge is the primordial Gnosis the serpent offered Eve . . . This
makes Satan not only father of lies, but father of all so-called Illuminati or
'enlightened ones' peddling freedom and salvation through science rather the
Redeemer . . .""

Solange Hertz then provides an account of the unification of Freemasonry with
Alchemy, the ""Great Work"", which was the attempt to make gold, and that one of
the adepts of this occult ""science"" was none other than Benjamin Franklin, who
rejected the Fatherhood of our Infinite God and the worship due Him in favor of
""the rights of man."" In fact Franklin conjectured that there may be gods, not
just a higher ""SOMETHING"". Franklin was a pure naturalist, dismissing the
supernatural, the Resurrection of the body, etc. [p. 11]

At one point this impious Founding Father said that he no longer believed in
miracles as such and that he could perform the same wonders as Jesus Christ!,
[Ibid.] adding blasphemy to his list of achievements.

To cite a few revealing passages from pages 12-13:

""Disbelief in the miraculous explains Franklin's presence at the opening of the
first Unitarian Chapel in England by Theophilus Lindsay, which became the
meeting place for liberal reformers hoping to replace 'outworn' Christianity by
scientific truth . . . Another companion of Franklin's at this event was his
close friend Francis Dashwood, Lord De Spencer, who had asked his help in
revising the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer. Franklin himself tells
us of the happy days he spent at the estate of this notorious libertine and
student of the cult, who . . . was said to celebrate black Masses amid the ruins
of an old abbey . . He and Franklin 'decided that the prayer-book was entirely
too long,' writes Sydney George Fisher in The True Benjamin Franklin.  '. . .
the young and sinful might attend more willingly if the service wet shorter. . .
All references to the sacraments and the divinity of the Saviour were . . .
stricken and short work made of Athanasian and the Apostles' Creed.' ""

Hertz then details pertinent facts, such as that the Commandments had lines
drawn through them, along with the deletion of the Te Deum and Venite.

""Strange, too, that the only phrase Franklin asked Le De Spencer to omit from
his first Preface was the description of the Old Testament as 'a Jewish book
very curious, perhaps more fit for the perusal of the learned than suited to the
capacities of the general illiterate part of mankind.' His reasons for this, who
knows? Although eventually he wrote only the final Preface, in America the
work----purged of all references to king and parliament----became known far and
wide as ""Franklin's Prayer Book,"" doing much to strengthen his public image as a
believer.  . . .

The popular scientific writer Roger Burlingame coined the phrase, 'America was
discovered; the United States was invented.' He meant only to make a distinction
between a principle and its application, but the eyes of faith see deeper than
that: America is the creation of Almighty God, but the United States, being
merely a political contrivance, can qualify only as a human invention. Mistaking
one for the other has disastrous consequences, for contrivances may fall apart
without warning as the United States nearly did during its so-called Civil War
and may now do by internal collapse. [Emphasis added.]

Catholics who mistake the United States for God's America may further fall more
easily into the heresy formally defined by Pope Leo XIII as Americanism.
Basically, it is naturalism in American dress, and it accommodates itself to all
the ideals of the Enlightenment.  French radicals of the last century expected
it then to produce a major schism in the Church under the able leadership of
Catholic bishops in the United States . . .

Like Franklin, most of its Founding Fathers were not Christians. Although they
often made references to the Deity, the God they invoked was their God, . . .
the God of nature in Christian dress. In fact the most influential among the
were not so much deists as thoroughgoing pantheists, for, being avowed
rationalists, they looked for divinity only in nature.  . . .

In Alchemy, a Green Dragon signifies the Great Work in its beginnings, and it
cannot have been coincidence that the Revolution was planned and carried out by
men who met regularly in a Boston tavern of the same name. So diligently did
they promote the serpent's cause that America today finds herself immersed in a
sea of neo-Gnosticism so pervading and controlling her moral, intellectual
political life that, by comparison, the Albigensian heresy which once ravaged
the whole of Christendom now looks like a harmless childhood disease.  . . .

Any citizen doubting that the Old Religion of the alchemists is the state
religion of the U.S. need only make a pilgrimage to the nation' s capital,
beginning with the Prayer Room established  . . . by joint resolution of
Congress in 1954. He will find there for his devotion a small central altar
flanked by two seven-branch candelabra, above which rises a stained glass window
showing George Washington kneeling. Below the Father of his country is the Great
Seal of the United States. Above him is the truncated pyramid surmounted by the
eyes of Horus, which constitutes the seal of Masonry and the Illuminati.""

It is historical record that the architect of the White House, James Hobran, was
the first Master of Federal No. 1, Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia. A
few years later, when the construction of the House and Senate wings was
commenced, another cornerstone contained a composition written by Daniel
Webster, in which he wrote that ""the cornerstone was laid by the President of
the United States and the Grand Master of Masons."" [p. 15]

Catholics took part in these ceremonies: the Archbishop of Baltimore's Masonic
brother Daniel Carroll served as an official of the events and his cousin,
Charles Carroll of Carrollton, took part in the Masonic ceremony inaugurating
the nation's first railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio, July 4, 1828, ""by turning
over the first bit of earth with a silver spade."" [Ibid.]

Another Masonic tract says, ""Masonry was everywhere active, indirectly as an
Order, but directly through its members, in behalf of a nation, conceived in
liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"",
[Ibid.] one of the basic doctrines of Freemasonry. The Holy Catholic Church has
always taught that men are not created equal but that God gives sufficient grace
to each man to save hi",,,,,,,,,,

and years. The covid fraud is causing a global genocide. This needs to end!
Here are the crimes committed or supported by governments, government advisory
groups, members of the World Economic Forum, the mainstream media, social
media platforms and others in positions of authority:

  • Extreme fear-mongering via press releases, media announcements and
    nation-wide advertisement, using taxpayers’ money
  • Inducing unnecessary fear and terror of a virus less lethal than a seasonal flu
  • Cynical use of new variants to promote fear and justify continued restrictions
  • Falsifying death records by stating covid as the primary cause of death when
    not applicable
  • Mask mandates on public transport, in shops, schools, work places and other
    public places – in many cases for hours a day – exposing the wearer to
    potential and actual damage to their mental and physical well-being
  • Forcing children and adults to take covid tests, often regularly, that are not fit
    for purpose, produce mainly false positives, and can cause damage to health
  • Using covid “cases”, which are based on false test results, for prolonging
    covid restrictions and lockdowns
  • Coercing people, including children, into taking an experimental “vaccine”,
    which is in fact a gene-modifying injection, can induce infertility, and is
    causing more adverse reactions and deaths than all other vaccines together
  • Promoting the use of this unlicensed gene therapy (=covid injection) as
    though it were fully approved and safe
  • Suppressing or underplaying the data regarding adverse reactions and deaths
    of the covid jabs
  • Ignoring the Nuremberg Code by not enabling people to give informed
    consent before vaccination or testing
  • Causing disruption and loss of education, and suppressing religious freedom
    by preventing and restricting worship
  • Restricting freedom of movement across borders, and during lockdowns,
    within the country
  • Causing job losses, business failures and loss of opportunities
  • Delaying diagnosis and treatment of conditions far more serious than covid,
    resulting in unnecessary loss of life
  • Forced quarantine of healthy people at their own expense
  • Suppression of the right to protest, freedom of association and freedom of
    speech
  • Censorship and suppression of scientific debate, giving voice only to
    “approved” agencies

                   “A compellingly candid story! Not argument or ideology but data—first-person facts
                    and utterly honest feelings.” PETER KREEFT—Author, Three Approaches to Abortion

                   “As a founder of the National Coalition for Life and Choice, I have always encouraged
                    people on both sides of the ‘life line’ to listen to and understand each other, though
                    they may never agree. Abby Johnson’s sincere and thoughtful story has much to teach
                    both sides.”
                        FREDERICA MATHEWES-GREEN—Author, Real Choices: Listening to Women,
                        Looking for Alternatives to Abortion, www.frederica.com

                   “I’m grateful to Abby Johnson for having the courage to tell her story as a former
                    director of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Unplanned. Though Planned Parenthood
                    provides other services for women, it is the largest abortion provider in America.
                    In this unique and compelling book, Abby shows the compassionate hearts of some
                    of her coworkers, takes responsibility for her own participation in abortions, and
                    shares the journey of how God in his grace and mercy delivered her from blindness.
                    I hope that by reading this story you will be moved to do what you can to offer help
                    and resources to women in need of them, and lovingly tell them the truth about their
                    unborn child.”
                        RANDY ALCORN—Author, ProLife Answers to ProChoice Arguments and Why Pro-Life?

                   “Abby’s story is one of great moral courage in an age that groans for lack of it. Hers is a
                    modern parable of hope for us all, witnessing to the truth that sets the human heart free.
                    A riveting story.” MARJORIE DANNENFELSER—President, Susan B. Anthony List

                   “Abby’s gripping story gives a rare glimpse into the heart that motivates both pro-abortion
                    and pro-life activities. Her book is a refreshing affirmation of the power of truth, which
                    overcomes even the thickest deceptions. Abby’s compelling experience gives invaluable
                    insight both to those involved in providing abortion and those who struggle to see
                    life triumph.”
                        DONNA J. HARRISON, M.D.—President, American Association of Pro-Life
                        Obstetricians and Gynecologists

                   “Unplanned is a powerful and compelling testimony of the power of prayer and love.
                    A story of courage, conviction, and conversion, the book will draw you into Abby’s life
                    and her journey as her eyes are opened to the truth.”
                        DR. ALVEDA C. KING—Pastoral Associate, Priests for Life; Founder, King for America;
                        Niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

                   “Think love and kindness can’t make a difference in the abortion debate? Read Abby
                    Johnson’s story and find out how a pro-life ministry’s peaceful and respectful witness
                    forever changed the heart of this former Planned Parenthood clinic director.”
                        JIM DALY—President, Focus on the Family

Unplanned.indd i                                                                                            11/1/2010 2:41:41 PM
                    “Abby understands how good people can be misled, as she was, to support abortion
                     under the guise of helping women. This is the remarkable story of how one director
                     of a Planned Parenthood clinic came to realize the truth about abortion—and what
                     she did about it.” EDUARDO VERÁSTEGUI—Actor, star of Bella

                    “Abby walked out of the abortion industry and into my office just next door. After
                     seeing her transformation from running a Planned Parenthood clinic to joining our
                     efforts to help women and save lives, I believe that anyone can change their mind on
                     abortion.” SHAWN CARNEY—Campaign Director, 40 Days for Life

                    “Bold, decisive, and a real trailblazer at Planned Parenthood . . . Abby Johnson, when
                     confronted with reality, was courageous enough to admit her compassion for others
                     was misdirected. Her journey of finding a new way to help women in crisis is truly
                     inspiring.” BOBBY REYNOSO—Executive Director, Coalition for Life

                    “Once I began reading this compelling chronicle of compassion, I could not put it
                     down! Abby’s narrative points to Christ’s story of redemption and will inspire readers
                     for generations to come. Unplanned shows that God has a plan and purpose not only
                     for Abby Johnson, but also for you and me, because every life matters.”
                          BRIAN BOONE—President/CEO, Life Centers

                    “In Unplanned, Abby shares intimate details of the happenings that ultimately led her
                     to leave her career as a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic director for ‘the other side
                     of the fence,’ where she now ardently advocates for the rights of the unborn. If you
                     have ever peacefully protested and prayed for an end to abortion, Abby’s story will
                     provide tremendous insights—and encourage you never to give up.”
                          TONY PERKINS—President, Family Research Council

                    “I could not put this book down. Abby’s honest and riveting account sheds light on the
                     fact that some Christians are conflicted but satisfied with the goal of ‘making abortion
                     safe and rare.’ Abby finally had the courage to face the truth about abortion because
                     of the way Christ’s love was reflected through the prayer, courage, and support of
                     individual Christians.”
                          MARGARET H. HARTSHORN, PH.D.—President, Heartbeat International

                    “‘Unplanned’ perfectly describes Abby’s book from the very first word to the last. Once I started
                     reading, I couldn’t put the book down . . . . Abby’s incredible story is a must-read for everyone.”
                          BRADLEY MATTES—Executive Director, Life Issues Institute; Host, Facing Life
                          Head-On (TV) and Life Issues (radio)

                                      To my parents,
                     who have always stood by me and supported me,
                       no matter what crazy ideas I have fallen for.
                         There are no better parents in the world.

                              To my husband and daughter,
                           whom I always hope to make proud.
                   I am so thankful that we are on this journey together.
                           I love you both more than sunshine.

                My story is not a comfortable one to read. I think it’s only fair to
                warn you of that up front. Not comfortable, but honest and true. As
                you are about to discover, I’ve spent years on the front lines of the
                face-off between pro-choice and pro-life advocates. Which side?
                Both sides. You are about to enter my journey from naive college
                girl to director of a Planned Parenthood clinic to advocate for fam-
                ilies in crisis, including the unborn members of those families.
                    I reveal my story not because I am proud of it. I am not. But
                my thinking and choices are not unlike those of so many people
                I have encountered. And until we each set aside our own prefer-
                ences for how we wish others would think and behave, or how we
                assume others think and behave, we won’t be able to understand
                those with whom we differ in order to engage in real dialogue and
                discover truth.
                    I’ve done my best to be true to my thinking and reasoning
                within each of these stages of my journey—no matter how faulty,
                how embarrassing, or how politically incorrect—so I suppose that

                                                                                   ix

Unplanned.indd ix                                                                 10/27/2010 2:24:42 PM

               at times you will ask the same questions I’ve been asked time and
               again. Were you really so gullible? Were you really so inconsistent
               between your values and your actions? Were you really so ambiva-
               lent, so naive, so foolish, so . . . you get the picture. My answer: Yes.
               I’ve also been asked, Were you and your pro-choice coworkers really
               driven by compassion and tenderness, by motives of truly helping
               women and making the world a better place? Again, yes.
                   I often find that people don’t like my answers.
                   That is understandable. My story is not neat and tidy, and it
               doesn’t come wrapped in easy answers. Oh, how we love to vilify
               our opponents—from both sides. How easy to assume that those
               on “our” side are right and wise and good; how those on “their”
               side are treacherous and foolish and deceptive. I have found right
               and good and wisdom on both sides. I have found foolishness and
               treachery and deception on both sides as well. I have experienced
               how good intentions can be warped into poor choices no matter
               what the side.
                   To this day I have friends on both sides of this polarizing debate.
               We all long for a story that shows that “our” side is right and good,
               and “their” side is wrong and bad, don’t we? But I testify that there
               is good and right and wrong on both sides of the fence. And even
               more shocking—we have far more in common with the “other”
               side than we might imagine.
                   But don’t slam this book shut because of what I’ve just said.
               Read it for that very reason. Read it to understand the surprising
               hopes and motivations on the “other” side. I was loved from one
               side onto the other. My hope is that many more thousands will be
               loved into truth as well. Maybe you will be the one loving someone
               on the other side of the fence.
                   So what side of the fence are you on? In all likelihood, as you

                                                        A NOTE FROM ABBY JOHNSON

                look through the fence, you see faulty thinking and harmful behav-
                ior on the other side. Here’s my question for you: are you ready to
                look through the fence and see goodness, compassion, generosity,
                and self-sacrifice on the other side?
                   Did you just feel yourself squirm? If so, welcome to my journey.

                Special Note

                The names and distinguishing details of some people in this book
                have been changed, including all Planned Parenthood volunteers
                and staff. While describing the events in this book, I relied not only
                on my memory, but on my personal correspondence and inter-
                views with others involved.

Many rabbis in their arrogance, have revealed the synagogue of satan's plan to
'fix the world' and exterminate all gentiles, which they call ""Amalek"".
""Rabbi Elyahu Kin from the Torah Ohr Synagogue in Los Angeles teaches his
congregation that God's command to jews to commit genocide still stands. And
today, Amalek means all nations that oppose the jews efforts to ""fix"" them. This
includes America and most of Europe."" and the destruction will happen in this
generation.
""In the Torah, God ordered the jews to completely exterminate all men, women,
and children of the Amalek. Why? Because they opposed the jews in carrying out
God's mission for them to ""fix the world"".
Some highlights:
1:51 - ""Why does this commandment appear to be so cruel? After all **it asks us
to Exterminate! To kill Men, Women, and Children**""
18:40 - ""the torah will be given and it will provide a blueprint, a guide, a map
to the jewish people, a nation, to tell them what to do, how to rectify this
world - Fix it! - clean it up!""
[they don't interpret the torah literally, but esoterically; plus for them, the
Gemara is above the torah. The Gemara is one of the many books of
judaism/pharisaism's Babylonian Talmud ]
27:42 - ""the jews have this job, to fix this world, to rectify this world, to
bring about HaShem's (God's) dwelling in this world.""
28:55 - ""We can not allow him (Amalek) to exist. He (Amalek) is the one who is
interfering with our job""
40:00 -""Why be so cruel to him? Get rid of all of him? Men, women and children?
Some people accuse us of being those who believe in genocide. That's what this
is calling for right? Being so cruel, sadistic.""
42:49 -""We are cruel to Amalek because we need to be......The Torah tells us you
gotta do it because he's gonna do it to you.""
44:40 ""This is the concentration of evil. The greatest evil. The Archenemy of
the jew. What difference does it make if it's a baby? Or if it's an adult. It's
the same thing, this baby will eventually be an adult. And this baby will
eventually try to harm you. Do it to him before he does it to you.""
56:40 - ""So who is he? Who is he today? ... the answer is very clear: Germany...
But there's Amalek all over the world. Amalek is everywhere.""
1:02:02- ""Edom is the grandfather of Amalek. If Amalek is Germany, then who is
Edom? Edom includes most of Europe. It includes the United States of America.""
1:03:58 - ""Jews received a mitzvah (command from God) of destroying any vestige
of Amalek...[which includes America and most of Europe] AND IT WILL HAPPEN IN
THIS GENERATION.""

RABBI RABINOVICH'S SPEECH OF JANUARY 12TH, 1952

A report from Europe carried the following speech of Rabbi Emanuel Rabinovich
before a special meeting of the Emergency Council of European Rabbis in
Budapest, Hungary, January 12, 1952:

""Greetings, my children; You have been called her to recapitulate the principal
steps of our new program. As you know, we had hoped to have twenty years between
wars to consolidate the great gains which we made from World War II, but our
increasing numbers in certain vital areas is arousing opposition to us, and we
must now work with every means at our disposal to precipitate World War III
within five years. [They did not precipitate World War III but they did
instigate the Korean War when on June 25, 1950 they ordered the North Korean
army to launch a surprise attack on South Korea. On June 26, the U.N. Security
Council condemned the invasion as aggression and ordered withdrawal of the
invading forces.

""Then on June 27, 1950, our Jewish American President Truman ordered air and
naval units into action to enforce the U.N. order.

""Not achieving their full goals, they then instigated the overthrow of South
Vietnam Ngo Dinh Diem, Premier under Bao Dai, who deposed the monarch in 1955
and established a republic with himself as President. Diem used strong U.S.
backing to create an authoritarian regime, which soon grew into a fullscale war,
with Jewish pressure escalating U.S. involvement].

""The goal for which we have striven so concertedly FOR THREE THOUSAND YEARS is
at last within our reach, and because its fulfillment is so apparent, it
behooves us to increase our efforts and our caution tenfold. I can safely
promise you that before ten years have passed, our race will take its rightful
place in the world, with every jew a king and every gentile a slave (Applause
from the gathering).

""You remember the success of our propaganda campaign during the 1930's, which
aroused anti-american passions in Germany at the same time we were arousing
anti-german passions in America, a campaign which culminated in the Second World
War.

""A similar propaganda campaign is now being waged intensively throughout the
world. A war fever [cold war fraud] is being worked up in Russia by an incessant
anti-american barrage while a nation wide anti-communist scare is sweeping
America.

""This campaign is forcing all the smaller nations to choose between the
partnership of Russia or an alliance with the United States. [now you see who
fabricated the cold war fraud and why?]

""Our most pressing problem at the moment is to inflame the lagging militaristic
spirit of the americans.

""The failure of the Universal Military Training Act was a great setback to our
plans, but we are assured that a suitable measure will be rushed through
Congress immediately after the 1952 elections.

""The russians, as well as the asiatic peoples, are well under control and offer
no objections to war, but we must wait to secure the americans. This we hope to
do with the issue of ANTISEMITISM, which worked so well in uniting the americans
against Germany.

""We are counting heavily on reports of antisemitic outrages in Russia to whip up
indignation in the United States and produce a front of solidarity against the
Soviet power.

""Simultaneously, to demonstrate to americans the reality of antisemitism, we
will advance through new sources large sums of money to outspokenly antisemitic
elements in America to increase their effectiveness, and WE SHALL STAGE
ANTISEMITIC OUTBREAKS IN SEVERAL OF THEIR LARGEST CITIES.

[It's a known historical fact that jews fabricate antisemitism on purpose not
only to help silence the opposition, but to gather together their 'lesser
brethnen'; many times jews disguised as arabs or others and provoked those
antisemitic attacks]

""This will serve the double purpose of exposing reactionary sectors in America,
which then can be silenced, and of welding the United States into a devoted
anti-russian unit.

(Note: Protocol of Zion No. 9, para. 2, states that antisemitism is controlled
by them. At the time of this speech they had already commenced their campaign
ofantisemitism in Czechoslovakia).

""Within five years, this program will achieve its objective, the Third World
War, which will surpass in destruction all previous contests.

""Israeli, of course, will remain neutral, and when both sides are devastated and
exhausted, we will arbitrate, sending our Control Commissions into all wrecked
countries. This war will end for all time our struggle against the gentiles.

"" WE WILL OPENLY REVEAL OUR IDENTITY WITH THE RACES OF ASIA AND AFRICA.

I can state with assurance that the last generation of white children is now
being born. Our Control Commissions will, in the interests of peace and wiping
out interracial tensions.

[now you also know who's behind the 'multiculturalist' and 'diversity' agendas]

""FORBID THE WHITES TO MATE WITH WHITES. The White Women must cohabit with
members of the dark races, the White Men with black women.

""THUS THE WHITE RACE WILL DISAPPEAR, FOR THE MIXING OF THE DARK WITH THE WHITE
MEANS THE END OF THE WHITE MAN, AND OUR MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY WILL BECOME ONLY A
MEMORY.

""We shall embark upon an era of ten thousand years of peace and plenty, the Pax
Judaica, and our race will rule undisputed over the world.

""Our superior intelligence will easily enable us to retain mastery over a world
of dark peoples.""

Question from the gathering: Rabbi Rabinovich, what about the various religions
after the Third World War?

Rabinovich:

""There will be no more religions. Not only would the existence of a priest class
remain a constant danger to our rule, but belief in an afterlife would give
spiritual strength to irreconcilable elements in many countries, and enable them
to resist us.

""We will, however, retain the rituals and customs of Judaism as the mark of our
hereditary ruling caste [remember, Judaism is pharisaism,not the ancient Mosaic
Law], strengthening our racial laws so that no jew will be allowed to marry
outside our race, nor will any stranger be accepted by us.

(Note: Protocol of Zion No. 17 para. 2, states:

'Now that freedom of conscience has been declared everywhere (as a result of
their efforts they have previously stated) only years divide us from the moment
of THE COMPLETE WRECKING OF THAT [Hated] CHRISTIAN RELIGION. As to other
religions, we shall have still less difficulty with them.')

""We may have to repeat the grim days of World War II, when we were forced to let
the Hitlerite bandits sacrifice some of our people, in order that we may have
adequate documentation and witnesses to legally justify our trial and execution
of the leaders of America and Russia as war criminals, after we have dictated
the peace.

""I am sure you will need little preparation for such a duty, for sacrifice has
always been the watchword of our people, and the DEATH OF A FEW THOUSAND JEWS in
exchange for world leadership is indeed a SMALL PRICE TO PAY. [Jewish elite is
always happy to allow many of the jewish pleb to die in order to further their
agendas]

""To convince you of the certainty of that leadership, let me point out to you
how we have turned all of the inventions of the White Man into weapons against
him. HIS PRINTING PRESSES AND RADIOS are the MOUTHPIECES OF OUR DESIRES, and his
heavy industry manufactures the instruments which he sends out to arm Asia and
Africa against him.

""Our interests in Washington are greatly extending the POINT FOUR PROGRAM (viz.
COLOMBO PLAN) for developing industry in backward areas of the world, so that
after the industrial plants and cities of Europe and America are destroyed by
atomic warfare, the Whites can offer no resistance against the large masses of
the dark races, who will maintain an unchallenged technological superiority.

""And so, with the vision of world victory before you, go back to your countries
and intensify your good work, until that approaching day when Israeli will
reveal herself in all her glorious destiny as the Light of the World.""

(Note: Every statement made by Rabinovich is based on agenda contained in the
""Protocols of the Elders of Zion."")

👉 Attached are 5 books written by catholic clergy regarding the synagogue of
satan !!!
The attached book ""The Plot Against the Church"" was written by John Paul I when
he was still a bishop in early 60s; it's a compilation of documents that he and
other clergy put together and distributed to many clergy attending Vatican II,
to warn them about the judeo/masonic conspiracy against the Church. John Paul I
who was murdered on his 33rd day of his pontificate - an important masonic
number - because he ordered a list to be made with all the ecclesiastical
freemasons in the Vatican and was going to silence them, and he was also going
to change how the Vatican bank worked, bank which is controlled by the
Rothschilds - I believe it was the latter who killed him.

Yourself
An Ark!
An Encyclopedic Digest of New Age
and Other Occult Assaults
on Christianity

Father Andrew O’Brien
Preface
Father Andrew O’Brien

Born on March 10, 1926 in Cork City, Ireland,
Andrew O’Brien was educated at St. Angela’s
College, CBC St. Patrick’s Place, and Christian
Brothers’ College. He came to Dalgan, Ireland in
1944 and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on
December 21, 1950.
  Father O’Brien was assigned to the Philippines
in 1951 and spent the next twenty years in pastoral
work on the island of Mindanao. He served in the
parishes of Aloran, Kolambugan, Bonifacio and
Corpus Christi, Iligan City. Though pastoral visi-
tation was difficult on poor roads with inadequate
transportation, Father O’Brien worked hard to
ensure that parish schools were run efficiently and
to high standards.
  He was appointed to the Region of Ireland in
1969 and over the next eighteen years helped in
various parishes in Ireland and Britain. His health
had never been very robust and he retired to Dal-
gan in 1987 where his meticulous bookkeeping kept
the farm accounts in order.
  Father O’Brien was an assiduous reader who

Make Yourself An Ark!                            1
engaged in a great deal of research into the New
Age Movement and tended to take a rather pessi-
mistic view of recent developments in the Church
and in theology.
  An Irish Priest is the pseudonymn used by Father
O’Brien when he recorded a series of discourses
in 1992 and 1993 entitled Make Yourself An Ark!
Without entertaining its lurid underpinnings, these
important recordings concisely describe the histor-
ical and spiritual formation of the phenonmenon
variously manifesting itself today as the New
World Order and the New Age Movement.
  Father Andrew O’Brien died peacefully in the
Dalgan Nursing Home in the early morning of
March 4, 2008—he is remembered as a man of
prayer and deep faith.
  An unassuming disciple of God, his acuity lit the
way for many followers around the world by reveal-
ing the enemies of the Faith in our own time.
  May he rest in peace.

                             FOREWORD

     The annual celebration of the Feast of Christ the K i n g is
 m e a n t to lead men "" to reflect on the Last Judgement, in which
 Christ, who has been cast o u t of public life, despised, neglected
                                                        1
 and ignored, will severely avenge such i n s u l t s . ""     Our Lord
 Jesus Christ came down to proclaim His Father's programme
 for the restoration of ordered life in the world and died, pro­
 claiming it. After Pope Pius I X in the Syllabus had catalogued
modern errors against the order of society demanded b y t h e
infinite dignity of the Life of Sanctifying Grace, restored through
 the foundation of the Mystical B o d y on Calvary, Popes Leo
 X I I I , Pius X , Benedict X V , Pius X I and Pius X I I have set
forth in their Encyclicals the positive programme for order
enjoined upon us b y Christ Our Head, Priest and King. In
this series of books I a m endeavouring to make known t h a t
positive programme to as m a n y as possible, so t h a t t h e y m a y
h a v e a thorough knowledge of the order of the world t h e y should
stand for as members of Christ. The series is placed under
the patronage of St. Joan of Arc. A t the beatification of t h a t
lovely saint in 1908, Blessed Pius X sadly reminded members
of Christ t h a t : "" All t h e strength of Satan's reign is due t o the
easy-going weakness of Catholics.""
    As I was not able to bring out this book w h e n i t was originally
written, i t has been laid aside for years. In the meantime,
the need for setting forth the full doctrine of the Kingship of
Christ has been forcibly brought home to m e b y the confusion
created in minds owing to the use of the term "" Anti-Semitism.""
The Hitlerite naturalistic or anti-supernatural rdgime in Germany
gave to the world the odious spectacle of a display of A n t i -
Semitism, t h a t is, of hatred of the Jewish N a t i o n . Y e t all
the propaganda about t h a t display of Anti-Semitism should
n o t have made Catholics forget the existence of age-long Jewish
Naturalism or Anti-Supernaturalism. Forgetfulness of the
disorder of Jewish Naturalistic opposition t o Christ the King

 Pius XI, Encyclical Letter, Quas Primas, On the Kingship of Christ.

                                  5
     The Kingship of Christ and the Conversion of the Jemsh   Nation

is keeping Catholics blind to the danger t h a t is arising from the
 clever extension of the term '' Anti-Semitism,'' w i t h all its
 war-connotation in the minds of the unthinking, to include any
form of opposition to the Jewish Nation's naturalistic aims.      For
 the leaders of the Jewish Nation, to stand for the rights
of Christ the King is logically to be "" anti-Semitic.""
    In March, 1 9 1 7 , Pope Benedict X V wrote to the Archbishop
of Tours : "" In the midst of the present upheavals, it is important
to repeat to men that b y her divine institution the Catholic
Church is the only ark of salvation for the h u m a n race . . . .
Accordingly, it is more seasonable than ever to teach
that the truth which liberates, not only individuals,   but societies,
is supernatural truth in all its fulness and in all its purity,  with­
out attenuation, diminution or compromise : in a word, exactly as
                                                               1
Our Lord Jesus Christ delivered it to the w o r l d . ""         These
sublime words of the Vicar of Christ have nerved me to do all
in m y power to set forth the opposition of every form of Natural­
ism, including Jewish Naturalism, to the supernatural Reign of
Christ the King. In addition, for over t w e n t y years I have
been offering the Hojy Sacrifice of the Mass every year, on the
Feasts of the Resurrection, Corpus Christi, SS. Peter and Paul
and the Assumption of Our Blessed Mother, for the acceptance
b y the Jewish Nation of the Divine Plan for order. Thus I
have been striving to follow the example of our Divine Master.
Blessed Pius X insists t h a t "" though Jesus was kind to those
who had gone astray, and to sinners, H e did n o t respect their
                                                                       2
erroneous convictions, however sincere t h e y appeared to b e . ""
The need of combining firmness in the proclamation of the in­
tegral truth w i t h loving charity towards those in error is in­
sisted on, even more emphatically, by Pope Pius X I : "" Com­
prehending and merciful charity towards the erring,"" he writes,
 "" and even towards the contemptuous, does not mean and can
n o t mean t h a t you renounce in any w a y the proclaiming of,
the insisting on, and the courageous defence of the truth and
its free and unhindered application to the realities about you.
The first and obvious d u t y the priest owes t o the world about

    A day will come when the Jewish Nation will cease to oppose
order and will turn in sorrow and repentance to H i m W h o m

for the Immaculate Heart of Our Blessed Mother. U n t i l t h a t

Supernatural Order of the world must be exposed and combated.

                  My abiding gratitude to my longtime friends Elizabeth and
                  Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily for their resolute belief in my work
                  and for shepherding this book through to fruition despite its many
                  bizarre trials and tribulations.
                     Thanks particularly to David Kupelian for his consistent encour-
                  agement, to my WND Editor Megan Byrd for her kindly, professional,
                  unruffled resolve, and to Katie Clark Vecchio for reducing my behe-
                  moth manuscript into a readable size.
                     I am especially grateful to the excellent WND team that made it
                  possible for one more politically incorrect book to reach the great
                  American public, and to my diverse and loyal readers who have
                  informed, encouraged, and supported me for these many years.
                     And finally, of course, to my generous, cherished family, all of whom
                  have succored me through good times and bad. I owe them my balance
                  and my joy.

                       Hate America: Libeling the World War II Generation

                             [T]his generation…left their ranches in Sully County, South Dakota,
                             their jobs on the main street of Americus, Georgia, they gave up
                             their place on the assembly lines in Detroit and in the ranks of Wall
                             Street, they quit school or went from cap and gown directly into
                             uniform. They answered the call to help save the world from the two
                             most powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled.1
                                                    —Tom Brokaw, The Greatest Generation (1998)

                  After World War II, it would take roughly fifteen years for
                  hedonistic “hate America” saboteurs to seduce the children of the
                  “Greatest Generation:”

                             the centuries by the alliance of philosophic genius and political
                             heroism, consecrated by the blood of martyrs; he is provided with
                             comfort and leisure by the most productive economy ever known
                             to mankind; science has penetrated the secrets of nature in order to
                             provide him with the marvelous, lifelike electronic sound and
                             imagery production he is enjoying . . . life is made into a nonstop,
                             commercially prepackaged masturbational fantasy…the new
                             American life-style has become a Disneyland version of the Weimar
                             Republic for the whole family.

                  2                     sexual sabotage

                      “Mother’s Flags” hung in the windows of most homes in my neigh-
                  borhood in 1942. Walking past them, I knew that when a blue star
                  was replaced with a gold one, another son or daughter had died to
                  protect me and my country.3 My gratitude and sense of obligation
                  began then, as 416,800 soldiers died, sixteen million fought under
                  arms, and millions of stateside Americans shouldered the burdens of
                  war.4 Little did we know that, having survived the enemy forces in
                  Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, our heroes would come
                  home only to be sabotaged, betrayed by a cult of American draft dodg-
                  ers lounging on the grassy slopes of Indiana University.
                      There, strolling along the tree covered green campus and the undis-
                  turbed wilderness of Dunn’s Woods, Alfred C. Kinsey, a zoologist,
                  studied gall wasps, taught classes, conducted “sexual research,” and, in
                  1948 and 1953, published reports that defamed our heroes, their fam-
                  ilies, and everything they fought and died for. With a cadre of devoted
                  followers, this “scientist” lied about our forebears and slandered the
                  World War II generation as promiscuous, adulterous, homosexual,
                  and even bestial. Abundant evidence proves that these sexual perver-
                  sions reflected the activities and character of the Indiana University
                  professors—not of our accused World War II fighting men and women.
                  Nonetheless, this false “statistical survey” of the morals of World War
                  II Americans would be believed and relied upon for generations to
                  come. Indeed, it continues to seduce our nation, even today.
                      In 1948, when Kinsey’s first book was published, I was thirteen
                  years old and wholly unaware that my freedom and safety were a leg-
                  acy granted me largely by unknown women bred as independent ladies
                  and unknown men bred with “religion and the spirit of a gentleman.”
                  Little did we know, in 1948, that the nation’s character would be
                  transformed from Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher to that of the tor-
                  tured youth of the 1948 pornographic novel, Amboy Dukes. We were
                  still being lifted aloft to higher things by the virtues of the founders’
                  generation reflected in our own World War II parents.
                      In 1948, my parents, like most people on our street, never locked
                  the car or our front door. The paint spray can was not invented until
                  1949, and graffiti did not mar shops and signs, even on the tough side
                  of town. Stores did not have wrought-iron bars protecting their win-
                  dows. Burglar alarms were rare indeed.
                      In 1948, I walked the mile from my house to Bancroft Junior High

                  School in Los Angeles. My fellow students discussed weekend plans—
                  parties, dances, and church and synagogue events—and we commiser-
                  ated with several movie stars’ children, whose parents were divorced.
                     On Saturdays, I often took the trolley from Hollywood to the beach,
                  where I spread my towel on the sand, searched my lunch bag for an
                  apple, and lolled about reading my book, swimming, and finding sea-
                  shells. Catching the last streetcar back to L.A., I sauntered home after
                  dark. Some Saturdays I might have tarried on Hollywood Boulevard,
                  peeking in the shops, enjoying an ice cream cone before I moseyed
                  home in the evening.
                     In 1948, as my friends and I meandered through beaches, parks, and
                  streets, we had no idea of the “sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll” that would
                  soon assault us. Like me, Elvis was thirteen, and John Lennon was only
                  eight years old. Few kids smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol. Drugs? A
                  very sophisticated friend once asked me if I’d like to smoke marijuana.
                  “What is it?” I asked. When she told me, I was stunned. “Why would I
                  ever want to do that?” I chalked up this strangeness to the fact that her
                  father was a film director. Again, we all knew about “movie people.”
                     Though very few kids had cars in the late 1940s and early 1950s,
                  one nice sixteen-year-old boy rode a motorcycle and occasionally
                  picked me up after classes at Fairfax High School. Of course, he never
                  tried to kiss me. The phrase “sweet sixteen and never been kissed” still
                  applied to most girls I knew. We never heard of “date rape.”
                     In 1948, my parents did not worry much about my safety. They
                  knew I didn’t take rides from strangers and I was a “good girl.” Even
                  our liberal crowd was not a sexually liberal crowd. Child molesters were
                  considered rare indeed, and though some of those queer fellows lurked
                  about in movie theaters, parents still usually felt their children’s inde-
                  pendence, and freedom, outweighed the rare possibility of harm.
                     This was the common reality in 1948. Americans of all races and
                  religions and from most socioeconomic backgrounds tended to share
                  similar morals. In fact, most single men were quite likely to be virgins
                  as adults, including Playboy’s Hugh Hefner and liberal CBS newscaster
                  Andy Rooney. Drafted in 1941, Rooney recalled his Colgate college
                  football team, saying that none of his friends there had smoked and
                  “we didn’t say ‘s—t’ or ‘f—k,’ and we didn’t sleep with our girl-
                  friends. Sex was only a rumor to us.”5
                     Former NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw wrote what is perhaps the

Sexual Sabotage .indd 3                                                                     4/19/10 5:10:04 PM
                  4                      sexual sabotage

                  most celebrated study of World War II Americans in his 1998 book,
                  The Greatest Generation. Through stories, private letters, poems, pic-
                  tures, and diaries, he documented and summarized their values and
                  ethical character. Brokaw wrote that their morals were as important
                  for victory as were “tanks and planes and ships and guns.” He thought
                  it would be wonderful to have a “statistical survey of America’s
                  strengths.” Indeed, such research would have been valuable.
                      For tragically, the world would soon view a false “statistical survey”
                  of World War II Americans defining this generation’s moral and ethi-
                  cal character. While our fathers and grandfathers fought World War
                  II, and while our mothers and grandmothers both overseas and on the
                  home front bore the burdens of war, Alfred C. Kinsey did not. Instead,
                  when America entered the war December 7, 1941, the forty-one-year-
                  old zoologist,6 was an Indiana University teacher “researching” human
                  sexuality. Wrapping himself in the mantle of “science,” Kinsey, a
                  secret sexual psychopath, would project his own sexual demons onto
                  the men and women appreciably called the Greatest Generation, the
                  Americans who saved the world from Hitler’s national socialism.
                      Riding on the financial support and seemingly impeccable creden-
                  tials of the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Research Council,
                  and Indiana University, Kinsey published his distorted data in Sexual

👉👉👉 (545) INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges! | Unforgettable Audition | Britain's
Got Talent - YouTube
""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

""INVISIBLE act SHOCKS The Judges!"" 👇 👇 👇
It's tragic that 99.9% of those watching this, believe this is some form of
visual illusion or stage trick... when in reality this is a man involved with
the occult, who made a diabolical contract in order to be able to manipulate the
laws of nature, a feature that no human is able to by himself... have you
noticed how the judges said in the beginning that the 'air became cold'? It's a
theological spiritual fact that when demons are present and active, the air
atmosphere drops!!!
But don't believe me... this is not 'what I think' nor 'my opinion'... 👇 👇 👇
=== Manly P. Hall, “The Secret Teachings of All Ages”, 1928, magicians do their
‘tricks’, aided by demonic entities after the magician makes a demonic contract
with them:
- “By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to
contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking…
It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the magician becomes for a
stipulated time the master of an elemental being… True black magic is performed
with the aid of a demoniacal spirit who serves the sorcerer for the length of
his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall
become the servant of his own demon. For this reason, a black magician will go
to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for
him beyond the grave.”
- “While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the elemental
demon may be fully convinced that he is strong enough to control indefinitely
the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily undeceived. Before many years
elapse he must turn all his energies to the problem of self-preservation. A
world of horrors to which he has attuned himself by his own covetousness looms
nearer every day, until he exists upon the edge of a seething mealstrom,
expecting momentarily to be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die –
because he will become the servant of his own demon – the magician commits crime
after crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence.”

Foreword

It has been almost a decade since the International technical guidance on sexuality education was first released in 2009. During
this period, the global community has come to embrace a bold and transformative development agenda to achieve a just,
equitable, tolerant, open and socially inclusive world in which the needs of the most vulnerable are met and where no one is left
behind. The 2030 Agenda for sustainable development shows us that quality education, good health and well-being, gender
equality and human rights are intrinsically intertwined.

Over this period, more and more young people have joined together to call for their right to sexuality education, and to urge
their leaders to deliver on political commitments for current and future generations. At the 2012 Global Youth Forum of the
International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), young people specifically called on governments to 'create
enabling environments and policies to ensure that they have access to comprehensive sexuality education in formal and non-
formal settings, through reducing barriers and allocating adequate budgets'.

Young people have not stood alone in this effort – they have been joined by communities, parents, faith leaders and
stakeholders in the education sector who increasingly champion sexuality education as an essential component of a good
quality education that is comprehensive and life skills-based; and which supports young people to develop the knowledge,
skills, ethical values and attitudes they need to make conscious, healthy and respectful choices about relationships, sex and
reproduction.

Despite these advances, too many young people still make the transition from childhood to adulthood receiving inaccurate,
incomplete or judgement-laden information affecting their physical, social and emotional development. This inadequate
preparation not only exacerbates the vulnerability of children and youth to exploitation and other harmful outcomes, but it also
represents the failure of society’s duty bearers to fulfil their obligations to an entire generation.

This revised and fully updated edition of the International technical guidance on sexuality education benefits from a new review
of the current evidence, and reaffirms the position of sexuality education within a framework of human rights and gender
equality. It promotes structured learning about sex and relationships in a manner that is positive, affirming, and centered on
the best interest of the young person. By outlining the essential components of effective sexuality education programmes, the
Guidance enables national authorities to design comprehensive curricula that will have a positive impact on young people’s
health and well-being.

Like the original Guidance, this revised version is voluntary, based on the latest scientific evidence, and designed to support
countries to implement effective sexuality education programmes adapted to their contexts.

We are convinced that if we do not meet young people’s calls for good quality comprehensive sexuality education, we will not
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) we have set for 2030, and the commitment that has been made to leave no
one behind. With this in mind, we are committed to supporting countries to apply the Guidance, and hope that teachers, health
educators, youth development professionals, sexual and reproductive health advocates and youth leaders – among others –
will use this resource to help countries to realize young people’s right to education, health and well-being, and to achieve an
inclusive and gender equal society.

           U.S. REDEPLOYMENT PROGRAM PACKAGE OVERVIEW

This employee packet contains important information about Intel’s redeployment program,
the options and benefits available to you, and helpful resources and tools. Please review the
entire packet including the Questions and Answers. If after reviewing all of this information,
you still need clarification on certain points, contact AskHR at 1-800-238-0486. You may
also refer to the links in the Questions and Answers for additional information.

Redeployment Overview
Intel believes employees are a valuable resource and is committed to providing an
environment where the internal movement of employees is accepted and encouraged. This
allows Intel to remain competitive and maximizes opportunities for employees.

The goal of redeployment is to attempt to move employees to parts of the business with
greater needs when there has been a change in business conditions. While the precise
structure of the program is subject to modification, Intel will continue to use its
redeployment program to help manage change.

Redeployment Eligibility
Employees cannot volunteer for the redeployment program. The business group determines
the criteria for redeployment and offers the program only to full-time and part-time
employees who meet the performance criteria at the time the redeployment activity occurs.

Redeployment should not be used by a manager as a substitute for performance
management. The redeployment program is not offered to interns, Intel Contract Employees
(ICE), or contingent workers.

Transition and Redeployment Period
Employees have a short transition period of 4-8 business days following notification before
starting the Redeployment Period. This transition time allows you to work with your
manager to wrap up your current work. The Redeployment Period starts at the end of the
transition period.

You can start accessing the internal and external job search resources during this transition
period. Once you start the Redeployment Period, your primary job is to look for a new
position within Intel.

If you have not secured a regular full-time or part-time position within Intel when your
Redeployment Period ends in 9 weeks, your employment with Intel will terminate and you
will be eligible to receive the separation benefits described below.

Separation and Release Agreement
You are required to sign (and not revoke, where applicable) a Separation and Release
Agreement (Agreement) to obtain (1) the Separation Pay; (2) the pro-rated Annual
Performance Bonus (APB) Payment, and (3) Healthcare except as otherwise provided below.
The Agreement states that in exchange for those benefits subject to the Agreement, you
agree to release Intel from any claims arising out of your employment with Intel. Please
read the Agreement carefully when you receive it, as it means you are giving up certain
rights in exchange for the valuable benefits that Intel is not required to offer.

1. Redeployment Period/General Questions

1.1 When do I start the Redeployment Period?
Employees have a transition period of 4-8 business days following notification before
starting the Redeployment Period. This transition time allows you to work with your
manager to wrap up your current work. You will start the Redeployment Period after the
transition period.

1.2 What is the Redeployment Period?
The Redeployment Period is the time you are in the Redeployment Pool until you separate
from Intel or are placed in a new job at Intel. The Redeployment Period is generally
anticipated to be nine weeks. During the Redeployment Period, you will continue to be an
at-will employee and you are subject to all Intel policies and guidelines, including the Code
of Conduct and Employment Guidelines. With this notice and/or the payments and benefits
provided during the Redeployment Period, Intel will exceed any obligation Intel has or may
have under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any similar
state or local laws (collectively, “WARN”).

1.3 How should I use the Redeployment Period?
You should use the Redeployment Period to focus on your internal and/or external job
search process. You can find job search and learning resources at Career, Development,
and Jobs. Refer to the section titled “Career Transition Services” to learn about external
services available to you.

1.4 I’m a Non-Exempt employee. Do I continue to submit timecards during the
Redeployment Period?
Yes. Each week you must access and save your timecard in Workday. Include the word
'redeployment' in the comments box when completing your timecard.

1.5 I have plans to take my sabbatical soon. Can I take it and then leave Intel?
No. If you have scheduled your sabbatical in the Sabbatical Scheduler, please cancel it.
We recommend using your Redeployment Period to search for a new job. If you reach the
end of your Redeployment Period and have not secured a new job at Intel your sabbatical
will be paid out at termination as described in the Pay, Stock and Benefits Handbook
Chapter 13: Paid Time Off (section 13.4).

1.6 I have a planned vacation in the next few weeks. Can I delay the start of my
Redeployment Period or extend my Redeployment Period?
No. You cannot delay the start of your Redeployment Period or extend your Redeployment
Period due to vacations, sabbaticals or other time off. We recommend using your full
Redeployment Period to search for a new job. Earned unused vacation is paid out in your

                                        Intel Confidential
                                           April 2023
final paycheck if you are a nonexempt employee, or an exempt employee who works in
California or Massachusetts.

1.7 Will I receive an Insights assessment during the Redeployment Period?
As part of your transition into redeployment, your manager will enter Insights feedback
based on your work and contributions since the last Insights period.

1.8 Will I participate in the annual Rewards process?
No.

1.9 Do I need to create new OKRs during the Redeployment Period?
While your focus during the Redeployment Period is to search for a new role, there is no
requirement to capture this in an OKR. You can score your OKRs as part of the transition of
your work during the few days following notification. If you accept a new position, you will
work with your new manager to create OKRs for your new role.

1.10 How will my APB payment be impacted if I find another role internally?
For the individual component, representing 25% of the total APB opportunity, each APB
eligible employee will receive an individual payout value reflective of their individual OKR
performance during the periods when they were not in Redeployment.

1.11 Can I accept an external full-time job or full-time consulting position during
my Redeployment Period?
Your employment with Intel will end when you accept an external full-time job or consulting
position. Your termination will be considered a voluntary termination and you will lose any
remaining redeployment job search time. However, you will receive Separation Pay benefits
at termination, subject to signing and not revoking (where applicable) the Separation and
Release Agreement.

1.12 Who do I contact for questions about my Visa status?
You should contact Fragomen at intelrft@fragomen.com.

1.13 Can I be terminated during the Redeployment Period because of misconduct
or performance problems?
Yes. During the Redeployment Period you are subject to all Intel policies and
guidelines, including the Code of Conduct and Employment Guidelines. Engaging in
conduct or activities that violate the Code of Conduct, Employment Guidelines or other Intel
policies, including failing to advise Intel that you have obtained an external full-time job or
consulting role, could result in immediate termination of your employment and loss of
eligibility for the benefits outlined in the US Redeployment Program Package.

2. Job Search Questions

2.1 If I am offered a new position at another Intel site, will Intel pay for
relocation?
Please check the job requisition; it will indicate if the job includes relocation.

2.2 Can I accept a temporary role or Gig Assignment during the Redeployment
Period?
The purpose of the Redeployment Period is to allow employees time to find regular full-time
or part-time roles at Intel. Accepting a temporary role or Gig assignment is not
recommended as it will distract you from searching for a regular full-time or part-time
position. If you have not secured a regular full-time or part-time position at the end of the
Redeployment Period, your employment with Intel will end.

                                    U.S. Redeployment Package
                                         Intel Confidential
                                            April 2023
2.3 If I decline a job offer from an Intel hiring manager that I don’t think is
suitable for me, will I be eligible for the Separation Package when I leave Intel?
Yes.

2.4 What happens to my remaining job search time if I decline a job offer during
the Redeployment Period?
You may continue your job search time until the Redeployment Period ends.

2.5 Can I extend my Redeployment Period if I am a final candidate for a full-time
position?
In general, the Redeployment Period will not be extended if you are being considered for
roles. You should be candid with the hiring manager about the timing of your Redeployment
Period. In the unique circumstance that you are a final candidate, and your Redeployment
Period is ending, please connect with the Talent Advisor team. If the Talent Advisor team
verifies that you are a final candidate for a full-time position, and a decision on the role will
be made within 1 week, Intel will extend your Redeployment Period for up to 1 week to
allow a final decision to be made. Only one extension will be permitted per individual.

2.6 I have accepted an internal position at Intel. What do I need to do to have my
termination cancelled?
You should go into the CPM Tool and click “Request to Change Job Status.” The system will
send an automated notification to the Business HR representative for the action. Once BHR
confirms that you have accepted an internal position, you and your manager will receive
confirmation emails indicating that you are no longer active in the CPM Tool and confirming
you will not be leaving Intel.

2.7 I have accepted an external position with another company. What steps do I
need to take?
Your employment with Intel will end when you accept an external position. Your termination
will be considered a voluntary termination and you will lose any remaining redeployment job
search time. However, you will receive the benefits outlined in the US Redeployment
Program Package, subject to signing and not revoking (where applicable) the Separation
Agreement.

2.8 Can I leave Intel before my separation date and be paid for the remaining
Redeployment Period?
No. If you leave Intel before your separation date you will not receive any pay in lieu of the
remaining Redeployment Period. Contingent on signing and not revoking (where applicable)
the Separation and Release Agreement, you may still receive the benefits outlined in the US
Separation Benefits section of your US Redeployment Program Package.

3. Separation Package Questions

General:

3.1 What is included in the Separation Package?
For a list of benefits and eligibility requirements, please refer to the U.S. Separation Benefits
section of your US Redeployment Program Package document.

3.2 If I accept a new job at Intel, do I still get the Separation Package?

                                     U.S. Redeployment Package
                                          Intel Confidential
                                             April 2023
If you accept a regular full-time or part-time role, you will be considered an internal transfer
and no longer eligible for the Separation Package.

3.3 Can I retire from Intel if I’ve received a Separation Package?
If you meet the requirements to retire under the U.S. retirement eligibility rules you may
retire from Intel and be eligible to receive Intel’s retirement benefits, consistent with the
terms of the program as well as the benefits outlined the US Separation Benefits section of
your US Redeployment Program Package.

3.4 How can I get an estimate of my separation payout?
Please access the CPM Tool Employee Portal to view an estimate.

Separation Pay:

3.5 How is Separation Pay calculated?
Separation Pay is equal to 4 weeks of pay plus 1.5 weeks of pay for every full year of
service. The total Separation Pay must not exceed 47 weeks. If you have been employed
less than 1 year of service, you will receive 4 weeks of Severance Pay. Your latest hire or
rehire date in Workday will be used to determine your length of service.

If you previously left Intel and did not receive a severance package, your time will be
bridged (based on prior employee classification and eligibility) to include your prior service if
you were rehired within two years of your termination date. If you previously left Intel and
received a severance package, your length of service will be calculated using your last
rehire date. If your most recent hire date is due to an acquisition, your length of service will
depend on the acquisition agreement.

3.6 What is included in a “week of pay” under the Separation Package?
   • For non-commissioned employees, one week of pay equals (base pay + any
     applicable differentials) divided by 52.
   • For commissioned sales employees, one week of pay equals (base pay + any
     applicable differential + 50% commission target) divided by 52.

3.7 How will Separation Pay be calculated if I am a part-time employee?
You will receive prorated Separation Pay based on your part-time status reflected in
Workday.

3.8 Does internship time count toward the length of service calculation for
Separation Pay?
Yes. Internship time will count toward the length of service calculation provided you were
hired at Intel into a regular full-time or part-time position within two years of your
internship assignment.

3.9 Does Intel Contract Employee (ICE) time count toward the length of service
calculation for Separation Pay?
No.

3.10 How will Separation Pay be taxed?
Separation Pay is subject to applicable taxes and withholdings and will be taxed at the
supplemental tax rate. Refer to Tax Rates and Information.

3.11 When will I receive my Separation Pay payment?
Refer to the Intel Corporation Severance Plan Summary Plan Description below.
APB Payment:

                                    U.S. Redeployment Package
                                         Intel Confidential
                                            April 2023
3.12 How is the APB Payment calculated?
As part of the Separation Package, non-retirement eligible employees who terminate in Q2-
Q4 may be eligible to receive an APB Payment prorated based on the number of months
worked within the calendar year. For example, employees who terminate any time in
September will receive 9/12ths of the APB payment. The individual component of APB will
be paid at 100% if you are in the Redeployment Pool on final day of the year. Employees
who terminate in Q1 will only receive an APB payment for the previous year. For employees
who are not retirement eligible, receipt of the Prorated APB payment is contingent on
signing and not revoking (where applicable) the Separation and Release Agreement.
Employees who are retirement eligible are not required to sign the Separation and Release
Agreement to receive the APB Payment as described in Pay, Stock and Benefits Handbook
Chapter 16: Pay and Bonuses (section 16.9).

3.13 How will the APB Payment be taxed?
APB Payment is subject to applicable taxes and withholdings and will be taxed at the
supplemental tax rate. Refer to Tax Rates and Information.

3.14 When will I receive my APB Payment?
It is paid no later than March 15th of the calendar year following termination.

Healthcare: Intel-Paid COBRA Premium:

3.15 What is COBRA?
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) is a federal law that
enables you and your enrolled dependents to continue healthcare coverage in the event that
you or they lose coverage as the result of certain qualifying events such as termination of
employment.

3.16 What does the Intel-paid COBRA premium cover?
The Intel-paid COBRA premium covers the medical, dental, vision plans you are
participating at the time of separation.

3.17 Do I need to enroll in COBRA to access the Intel-paid COBRA healthcare
(medical, dental and/or vision) premiums?
Eligible employees will be automatically enrolled in COBRA with the Intel-paid COBRA
premium subject to signing and not revoking (where applicable) the Separation & Release
Agreement. Automatic enrollment will provide you and your eligible covered dependents
with the medical, dental, and/or vision coverage that you had as an active employee.

COBRA election materials will be mailed to you from the Intel Health Benefits Center,
typically 2-3 weeks after your last day of employment. Please read the COBRA materials to
understand your COBRA benefits. You do not need to take action to elect medical,
dental, and or vision and you will not be required to make premium payments for
these benefits during the first 12 months of COBRA coverage.
During the first 12 months you will receive a monthly invoice showing no premium payment
is due for COBRA coverage. After the COBRA subsidy ends, you will continue to receive a
monthly invoice updated with the amount due to continue COBRA coverage.

3.18 When does my Intel active healthcare coverage (medical, dental, and/or
vision) end?
Your medical, dental, and vision coverage ends on the last day of the month during which
your employment with Intel ends.
3.19 When does COBRA begin?

                                   U.S. Redeployment Package
                                        Intel Confidential
                                           April 2023
COBRA coverage is effective the day after your active coverage ends. You will not
experience a gap in healthcare coverage.

3.20 How do I opt out of automatic enrollment in COBRA?
If you do not wish to be enrolled in COBRA coverage you will need to contact the Intel
Health Benefits Center at (877) 466-9236 to opt out.

3.21 Can I choose to receive the healthcare cash payout option in lieu of the
Intel-paid COBRA premium benefit?
No. The healthcare cash payout is only available for individuals eligible for Medicare
(generally those age 65 and over) within the 12 months following separation from Intel and
who have signed and not revoked the Separation and Release Agreement. COBRA coverage
is of minimal value to Medicare-eligible individuals who are no longer active employees. The
healthcare cash payout is meant to provide a similar benefit as the Intel-paid COBRA
premium.

3.22 Does the Intel-paid COBRA premium cover my Health FSA?
No. Once you terminate employment with Intel, your pre-tax Health FSA contributions
cease. If you are enrolled in Health FSA on the day prior to your termination, then you will
have the opportunity to elect Health FSA via COBRA for the remainder of the year.

To elect to continue your Health FSA, please reference the COBRA election materials.

For additional information on Health FSAs following termination, please reference:
    • Pay, Stock and Benefits Handbook Chapter 8: Flexible Spending Accounts
    • Pay, Stock and Benefits Handbook Chapter 11: COBRA Continuation Coverage.

3.23 Should I participate in Annual Enrollment while in the Redeployment
Program?
Yes. As an employee of Intel, you should review your benefit elections for the coming year
and decide what is best for you. If your COBRA extends into the following calendar year,
your elections at annual enrollment will apply to your COBRA coverage in the following year.

3.24 Am I eligible to change plans at Annual Enrollment?
COBRA participants have the same rights as active participants to change their COBRA
elections at Annual Enrollment and upon a qualified change-in-status event. For additional
information on change-in-status events, see Pay, Stock and Benefits Handbook Chapter 5:
Health and Insurance Benefits Enrollment.

3.25 What happens to my annual calendar year accumulators (i.e. year to date
payments towards your deductible and out of pocket max) if I elect COBRA?
As long as you are enrolled in COBRA plan that matches your active plan enrollment, your
annual calendar year accumulators will continue. For additional information please
reference: Pay, Stock and Benefits Handbook Chapter 6: Medical and Vision Plans

3.26 What happens after my Intel-Paid COBRA premium is exhausted?
You may continue your COBRA coverage at your cost through the end of your maximum
COBRA coverage period, generally 18 months. You will be billed at the r",,,,,,,,,,

                                           Preface
I was born in Bismarck, North Dakota in 1950. The winters were brutal. We didn’t know about
wind chill back then; we just read the thermometer outside my parents’ bedroom. In the winter it
often read 30 degrees below zero. During my childhood in Bismarck, I never heard of a homeless
individual. Obviously, there was no way anyone could camp out under a bridge and survive the
winter nights. Today, a former nursing home has been transformed into the Ruth Meier
Hospitality House and welcomes anyone who needs shelter.

My father had a working-class job as a radio/TV technician. My mother was a stay-at-home
mom with three kids, but she had inherited some funds when an uncle died. They purchased a lot
and built the basement of what was to be a two-story home. We lived in the basement until they
could save enough to build the rest of the house. This house was located on a block that doesn’t
resemble many neighborhoods today. The block consisted of single-family homes, but also
contained small apartment buildings where there were six to eight apartments. (The apartment
houses were great at Halloween because you could stay warm for Trick or Treat knocks on eight
doors!) Many of my friends at school lived in apartments and there was never, to the best of my
knowledge, any talk about why they didn’t live in a house like we did.

Once the war was over, housing was needed for the returning veterans. Several blocks of single-
family homes were somewhat hastily constructed. Then in the 1960s, apartment complexes arose
with over 50 apartments in them. The rest of the city development followed patterns in other
cities and housing became more segregated by income. As Bismarck was mostly white, there
was no visible segregation by race.

After graduate school in Wisconsin, I escaped the cold Midwest and came to Oregon. Like most
people, I lived paycheck to paycheck. But I had family who would have supported me and
helped me out if I needed it. I did have one experience where a boss wanted to suspend me for a
month, and I said that I would have to quit so that I could access my retirement account to pay
my mortgage. Fortunately, she changed her mind and agreed to just put a letter in my file.
Needless to say, it was time to move on. But that was a rather mild experience compared to what
most people deal with at least once in their lives.

I certainly was aware of homelessness in Portland. It was often in the news and there were well-
known shelters in the central core area. In the 1990’s a group of us made tacos to take down to
serve at one of them about once a month. We called ourselves Team Taco. I remember how
grateful and thankful everyone was who came through the line. Once that stopped, my
encounters with homelessness were few and far between.

When my husband and I moved to Silverton in 2016, I would have been quite surprised if you
had told me there were homeless individuals and especially homeless families here. They were

                                                                                                   1
never very visible and there were no shelters. When I became involved in the warming shelter
effort in 2017, I became aware of the number of homeless Silvertonians, a figure much larger
than I would have expected. But what amazed me the most was all of the activities that citizens
in the town were engaged in to help individuals down on their luck. I decided I had to write
about it. If we could do it, so could others.

Think of this book as a manual. Pick something that you find interesting and take it on as a
project in your town. I assure you that you will learn things you never knew and will appreciate
the difference that you can make in the lives of others.

                                                                                                   2
                                         Introduction
At 2:00 AM in the morning the baby started a wail that only increased in volume. The mother
picked her up and held her tightly to her chest trying to stop her cries. With a worried look on her
face, she looked around and listened. Why was she concerned? Babies cry all the time. But not
all of them are sleeping with their parents in a tent in the corner of a large room located on the
second floor of Oak Street Church, which housed the Silverton Warming Shelter. There were
about 20 people asleep on their cots and she knew that if the baby kept crying, someone would
get angry and yell out. They might be forced to leave. She, her husband, and their four children
now spent every night there. They had previously had a business and their last client refused to
pay a fairly large sum of money that was owed to them. They ended up being evicted from their
apartment and no one would rent to them even after the husband had secured another job. It
appears that having an eviction on your record is worse than having a criminal conviction.

It’s 2020 in one of the richest countries in the world and a family with four children and a dog
are living in their car and spending their nights at a warming shelter. Is this the best we can do?
How did we get here? Have there always been homeless people? Have we always ignored them?
Was there always a lack of affordable housing? Were homeless people always seen as
freeloaders unwilling to work? What are the facts?

This book attempts to provide answers to some of those questions in regard to one small town in
Oregon – Silverton. With a population of around 10,0000, Silverton is nestled between the
rugged Cascade mountains to the east and the lush Willamette Valley to the west. It is about a
20-minute drive from the state’s capital, Salem, and about an hour to the state’s largest city,
Portland. We begin with a short history of homelessness as it has occurred over the decades in
Silverton. But that history is not the main thrust of this book. Rather, it is about some remarkable
people in Silverton who have contributed hundreds of hours to make a difference for people who
end up homeless or in dire straits. They start a warming shelter. They provide food. They help
students with lunches and activities when their parents can’t. They teach parenting classes. They
help people secure employment. They help people get any federal assistance that is available.
This book is a model for other communities who don’t want to wait for the federal government
or the state government or even the county government to ‘solve’ the problem of homelessness.
This book is for people who want to take charge and make a difference in their communities –
people who think the homeless, or those who might end up homeless without this assistance,
have just as much a right to be in their town as they do.

                                                                                                   3
                     Were there always homeless people in Silverton?
The word homeless was unlikely to have entered the lexicon in Oregon until well into the
development of the area. Many of the white settlers had just crossed the continent on the Oregon
Trail and were used to living with only a covered wagon as their residence. Robert Horace
Down, in his History of Silverton Country written in 1926, explained that this was timber country
and a one room log cabin could be easily built with second growth Douglas fir which grew
“straight and smooth without limbs.” 1

Daniel Waldo settled in what is now known as The Waldo Hills between Silverton and
Sublimity. In an interview in 1878 he reflected on his first years in Silverton Country, ‘’Oregon
was just like all other new countries. For a long time, we had to pack our own blankets and no
place to sleep. There was only a little town at Oregon City. I always kept people without
charging them a cent. I accommodated quite a number of people in my house out here on the
road. We had not very many beds; they would sleep on the floor anyhow.”2

Many of the later settlers were of Scandinavian descent – either Swedish or Norwegian – and had
cultural ties that lent themselves to helping each other out. Individuals without any family could
pitch a tent or create a small lean-to without any housing regulations or zoning laws to prevent
them.

In the first part of the 20th century, people who had homes often rented one or more rooms to
single people. Women teachers were often the renters or the local timber worker. They were
usually inexpensive. There is some reference to lodging houses in the historical literature where
several rooms might be for rent in one building. There were not yet apartment buildings where
the entire edifice consisted of single apartments.

It is likely that the first serious case of homeless in Silverton came about during the Great
Depression. Still a vibrant part of his community, Jack Hande, who was born in Woodburn in
1931, moved with his family to Silverton when he was just six months old. In terms of people in
need when he was growing up in the 30’s and early 40’s, he remarked, “As long as I can
remember, people came to our door asking for food or work. We didn’t look upon them as bums.
25% of the workforce was unemployed. They were good people with bad luck who just were
traveling through the area. One man, who had come all the way from Australia, Claude Spiney,
managed to get a job fixing up someone’s yard. They recommended him and it snowballed. He
became fully employed and some people with money helped him get a home and he lived in that
little house on Fiske Street for a long time.” Hande remembers the federally funded Works
Progress Administration crews working in Silverton. They hand dug ditches in the roads to
install pipes and repair the surface.

Hande edited and published the four volume Silverton Stories from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s that
contain recollections of many Silverton residents. It is interesting that even when the times were
hard, these writers had fond memories of growing up in Silverton. Much like elsewhere, the
children spent a great deal of time outdoors swimming and catching fish in the creeks, playing
games with friends, and walking to school. Sporadically mixed in with these stories are a few
references to where they lived. When it was a single person, they often mention boarding in
someone’s house. Leonard Strobel recounts the following, “From 1942 I boarded with Thad and
Lovena (Lovey) Blust on Madison Street. Max Blust was employed at McCord field; therefore,
they had an empty bed! At $25 a month including meals and laundry, I jumped on the offer.” 3
When families, usually the mother and children, picked strawberries for farmers in the summer,
they sometimes were able to live in cabins provided on the farm. 4 The supply of rental housing
was never abundant during the first half of the 20th century. During the 30s, there was little if any
migrant labor coming from the South, so the school year was made to accommodate the
strawberry picking in the spring and the hops picking in the fall. 5

Hande tells the story of Clark Gable who stayed in Silverton in his twenties. He had a job and a
room in the Cottage Hotel on Main Street. This was the type of room where you shared a
bathroom down the hall. Someone helped him get into drama school and the rest is history.
During the war, Hande remembers a family that lived in a vacant commercial building on North
Water Street. They would have been called gypsies at the time. They were nice people according
to Hande and they had a couple of boys. No one gave them any trouble or tried to kick them out.
Hande was a schoolteacher from 1956 to 1978. He remembers all kinds of kids and their
families. Some kids were hard pressed, but they were all in some kind of a home. He doesn’t
have any memory of them being mistreated because of their situation.

During the Depression, men would ride the rails hoping to gain employment in the towns around
the route. James Wright, telling the story about his parents who were berry farmers, made a clear
distinction between bums and hobos. “Mom and dad used to go to where they knew they got off
the train to pick up berry pickers. They had about 3 or 4 cabins to house them, and they were
sure grateful. Since this was during the Great Depression time most, if not all of them, weren’t
bums, but hobos - willing and looking for work. When it really got hot my folks would
sometimes take them to Silver Falls Park for a treat --- they sure liked that.”6 Note that there was
still a stigma to the word bums.

Cheryl Arbuckle, one of the writers in Hande’s book, commented that “jobs for any age were so
few and far between. Our little town of 2,500 was struggling to keep families fed. And
households intact.”7 “Jobs were scarce with at least 50% unemployment. I was lucky to have a
job. Most people were on government relief. My beginning pay was 25 cents per hour,”
explained Norman Kolln another contributor.8 Virginia McKim, writing in Growing up in

Silverton, stated, “I didn’t understand then about the Depression and my dad looking for a job for
over a year before coming back to Silverton to grow his own food.”9

The programs many rely on today to help pay for accommodations such as Social Security,
disability, unemployment insurance, and Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), didn’t go
into effect until 1935.10 In 1937, the government took the lead on public subsidized housing, but
at the outset, that did not occur in small towns such as Silverton. While job programs such as
those created by the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps helped
employ people, usually men, they didn’t go into operation until 1939. 11 However, once the
Second World War started, jobs became more plentiful and many an able-bodied man in
Silverton was able to obtain employment in Portland or Vancouver, Washington in one of the
three Kaiser shipyards. Begun in 1937, Kaiser’s ships outperformed other ship builders. While it
is hard to fathom, Liberty ships “were typically assembled in a little over two weeks, and one in
less than five days.”12

There have been a number of recessions since the Great Depression caused by the impact of the
Korean War, monetary policy, oil embargos, wage-price controls, and even fear about whether
the dot.com business could survive the Y2K scare. 13 Each of these impacted housing,
employment, and subsequently homelessness. As stated in the following interviews, Silverton
has always had some homeless people, but it was not until the impacts to the economy in 2007-
2009, that it became more pronounced. Called the Great Recession, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics has labeled it the worst recession since the Great Depression. 14 The Gross Domestic
Product, a key indicator of the state of the economy, was down 8.4% in the fourth quarter of
2008 and didn’t rise to a positive until the third quarter of 2009.15 One of the areas of the
economy that was hardest hit was the housing market. Rising home prices, loose lending
practices, and the sub-prime mortgage market have been cited as the key causes. 16 This recession
resulted in the loss of jobs, homes, and savings, all of which can be precursors to homelessness
and in any event spiral down to those who are very low-income fairly quickly. Homelessness
became more visible and even small towns like Silverton started to be aware of a problem that
heretofore had only applied to larger cities. I interviewed three individuals who have lived and
been active in local issues for the last few decades to get their views on this increase in
homelessness.

Jim Squires is a businessman who has been very active in the local government and other
concerns in Silverton. He has always been aware of homelessness in the community. “You don’t
have to hold a sign on the corner to indicate that you are homeless. Sometimes these people look

just a little rougher than normal and have a large bag full of some of their belongings. I’ve seen
people take items out of the garbage and end up selling them on the curb to make money.” In his
time in Silverton, he doesn’t ever recall the discussion of homelessness coming up with the City
Council or frankly in the local newspapers, at least until recently. In the past, according to
Squires, people thought they were just passing through if they didn’t know them. And perhaps
they were. But Squires knew they were there, sometimes seeing people camp out by the bridge
next to the local bowling alley. In the 80s and 90s, it became more obvious with some people
sleeping in front of the stores in town. But they were usually gone by the morning.

Squires tries to do his bit by helping out where needed – buying a slice of pizza for someone or
giving someone a coupon to take to the local McDonald’s so they can have a meal. Sarah White,
one of the founders of Sheltering Silverton, reached out to Jim about the needs of a man who was
a Marine Corps veteran. Jim stepped up to the plate and offered to take him in. After spending
three or four months lodging at Squires’ house, the man was able to find his own place. Squires
himself was in the Marine Corps and has a deep concern for veterans, especially those in need.

Stu Rasmussen served on the City Council of Silverton from 1984 to 1996 and again from 2004
to 2008. He served two terms as Mayor in the 1990s and three terms from 2008 to 2014. He
describes himself as a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. He operates the Palace Theater,
once owned by his father, and also owns a television production studio in Mt. Angel and
manufactures the KissMeter, a coin-operated relationship analyzer.

Rasmussen describes two men who were the most well-known homeless people in Silverton until
a few years ago. He describes them as polar opposites. Johnnie was in a wheelchair but was often
loud and obnoxious. “He would often get in your face when he was panhandling or making
demands inside of stores,” Rasmussen explained. Everyone knew who he was. While he had
family in town, he ended up living on the streets. Next to Silver Creek on Main Street, one could
often find him or his belongings. Sarah White helped Johnnie find permanent housing once, but
he was later kicked out because of his drinking. He came back to Silverton and Sarah once again
found him a place to live after a stay in the local hospital.

The other man was named Mike. He was the face of homelessness in Silverton for 20 years. He
was smart, according to Rasmussen, and knew which shelters to go to. “He was harmless,
benign, and intelligent. His family offered to help out, but he just preferred to sleep outdoors,”
explained Rasmussen. He passed away recently of renal failure.

Most of what people hear about homelessness comes from news reports about the big cities. But
small towns have their own unique issues. “We are on Silverton Standard Time,” quips
Rasmussen, “40 miles and 40 years from Portland (the largest city in Oregon).” Rasmussen adds
that “you can’t be anonymously homeless in Silverton. There aren’t any ‘others,’ they are all us.”
With the Great Recession of the late 2000s and 2010s, things changed. The big cities ran out of
resources and some people started to drift into Silverton from Salem or Portland. “These people
stood out in Silverton because they were newcomers,” explained Rasmussen. And because
Silverton is still a town of only 10,000 people, none of the resources that larger cities had
secured were available – no overnight shelter, no social services, and no available affordable
housing. “One only needs to look at the discussion of placing four pods to house women on the

                                                                                                     7
grounds of St. Edward’s Episcopal Church in 2018 to see the difference in attitude of
Silvertonians toward the homeless,” Rasmussen added.

Chief of Police Jeff Fossholm has been in service to the city for the last 32 years. He quips that
he has hired staff who have lived fewer years than his tenure with the city. Fossholm expresses
what most people in Silverton think – it is a great community. He and his officers know most of
the people who are homeless in the city. They are not usually very visible and camp out in the
park or by the bridge. “What you don’t often see, however,” Fossholm adds, “is the people who
are couchsurfing, spending nights with different friends or family.”

The Silverton Police Department does what it can to help people out. When someone was
exhibiting signs of mental illness and didn’t have any place to go, the police used to be able to
take them to the Oregon State Hospital in Salem. The officer would ring the bell and then
participate with the staff person in an interview. The staff person often agreed with the officer’s
assessment and the person was admitted. As the facility became overcrowded and fewer people
were admitted, this became a more difficult route. Fossholm commented that 25 years ago there
was a facility in Salem where officers could take someone who was a danger to himself and
others from alcoholic abuse rather than place the person in jail. There is still a place for addiction
help called Bridgeway, but a person has to enter voluntarily. Fossholm cites his view of the three
top reasons for homelessness: 1) lack of better facilities and programs for those with mental
illness, 2) lack of programs for those with substance abuse, and 3) the strict housing and zoning
rules that make it difficult for many to find affordable housing.

He adds that the police do their best to help people out. “Homelessness isn’t a crime,” he says.
“It could be any of us. We don’t roust people out of a camp unless there is an overaccumulation
of trash or if there is potential for a fire.” Most of their interaction with the homeless is through
complaints from the public. Fossholm is very supportive of the work that Sheltering Silverton is
doing. It’s an opportunity to work with them when the police get a call about someone. “At least
now there is somewhere we can refer them to,” he adds. Fossholm is referring to the organization
that started with a short-term warming shelter in 2015 and which is the subject of the next
chapter.

                                                                                                     8
                                     Sheltering Silverton
Four women came together in 2015 in order to help the people in Silverton who were
experiencing homelessness and were particularly vulnerable given the prediction of freezing
temperatures in the next few weeks. Each of them brought their own experiences to bear as they
explored what they could do to help the homeless who were increasing in number.

Sarah White had a less than ideal childhood herself. Her father was an alcoholic and also used
hard drugs. He would disappear for days at a time. Her parents moved around a lot in Southern
California when she was young. There was also a lot of violence in her home. When she was
seven years old, her mother left her father and took a job as a waitress. As a result, Sarah
identified with poverty growing up. When she married her husband Dmitry, he was soon
stationed in Germany. In Germany, Sarah became a Family Readiness Group leader in the Army.
This group helped to support families who were deployed. She mostly worked with women.
After his discharge, they moved to Silverton in 2012. In Silverton, Sarah took a position as case
manager for SACA, Silverton Area Community Aid17 in 2015. SACA serves as a food bank and
also provides emergency aid for rent, transportation, and utility payments for those in need. She
loved the job. But she soon became frustrated with the lack of services available locally,
especially for women who were fleeing domestic violence, families with children, and seniors.
She had majored in Family and Human Services in college and she knew that more could be
done. One of her chief concerns was a man in a wheelchair who was homeless. Really? She
couldn’t believe that social services were so lacking in her community that they couldn’t even
take care of him. He was one of the first people helped by Sheltering Silverton.

Jennifer Ohren was a friend of Sarah’s who also had worked at SACA. Jennifer was born in
Silverton and struggled as a young adult with alcohol and drugs. In the early 2000s, now in
Salem, she ended up losing the house she was in and began living in a car. She had been living
with the grandmother of a friend of hers and the family members kicked them out. Jennifer
always had a job. She often worked at a local coffee shop across from the courthouse in Salem.
She got off drugs and has been clean for eight years. She worked at Outside IN, an organization
in Portland that has a health clinic and young adult programs that “strive to meet people where
they are and provide safe, affirming spaces for our community to receive judgment-free care and
support.”18 In addition to this position, she was on call at St. Joseph’s Shelter associated with the
Benedictine Abbey in Mt. Angel, just north of Silverton. From both of these experiences,
Jennifer explains that she pretty much has seen everything, from drug abuse, to homelessness, to
victims of domestic violence, etc. She also has managed a food pantry run by the Benedictine
Mission called Helping Hands, a migrant men’s shelter, and an apartment complex for farm
workers. Today, she is employed by Northwest Human Services in Salem and serves as the
Congregational Secretary at Trinity Lutheran Church in Mt. Angel.

Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building all three. Each of
these documents serves a very specific purpose, and they’re built from tested
frameworks that don’t just look good, they read with the clarity and precision
recruiters want. The Statement of Purpose gives your transition and direction
context; the One-Page Career Summary captures your profile at a glance for
executive reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me letter is the sharp positioning
tool that gives you presence even before the interview.
Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400 respectively, $1000 in total.
But considering our work so far and your trust in the process, I’ll lock the
full package in for $900 flat. You already know this isn’t about documents, it’s
about traction, and half effort doesn’t produce half results. It produces none.
Let me know if I should proceed and we’ll lock these in right away.

    Ted,
    You have done a great job pulling everything together, and I’m glad we now
    have most of the key pieces in place. However, I noticed we're still missing
    a few critical components: your Statement of Purpose (SOP), a One-Page
    Career Summary, and a “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter. These aren’t just nice
    to have, after several meetings I had with recruiters today, they made it
    clear that for distribution to be taken seriously, these supporting pieces
    are now considered essential.
    They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth, and quickly show
    hiring teams why you're a standout candidate. Let’s get these done to
    position you properly from the start. Are you open to letting me build them
    in to match the rest of the strategy?

              To fully strengthen your positioning throughout the distribution
              process, I’ll need you to forward both your cover letter and
              statement of purpose. These aren’t just supporting documents
              they’re key in establishing your intent, focus, and relevance to
              each role. They allow us to present a complete, compelling
              narrative that goes beyond your technical skillset.
              Including them ensures we’re not just sending a resume, but
              delivering a full professional profile that speaks directly to
              what hiring managers are screening for. Once I have both, I’ll

              moving at full speed.

                            Let me clarify, this is precisely where my line of
                            work comes in. The reason I didn’t ask for access to
                            your primary Gmail is because I fully respect its
                            sensitivity. What I suggested was creating a
                            dedicated, job-specific email—one managed on your
                            end that I can temporarily access solely for resume
                            distribution purposes. This isn't about reading your
                            personal messages; it’s about directly managing
                            outreach, following up with hiring teams, and
                            keeping the process fast and controlled.
                            That’s the core difference between what I do and the
                            “networking-only” strategies you’ve been exposed to
                            before. Resume distribution, done right, involves
                            active engagement with decision-makers not just
                            uploading your résumé and hoping for a reply. If
                            you'd prefer, you can create a clean inbox
                            specifically for this purpose and send over the
                            credentials. That allows me to deliver what you
                            signed up for efficient, direct positioning. Let me
                            know your thoughts.

                                      give you a rating or a tip.

                                      No matter.  The phone number and e-mail on
                                      the current resume are the best two.

                                        Understood, Ted. While Microsoft

                                        won’t sit idle. I already have enough
                                        data to proceed strategically without
                                        risking overlap. Let’s keep moving
                                        forward I’ll manage the rollout on my
                                        end, and once your access is restored,
                                        we can sync everything seamlessly.
                                        Also, I delivered the second part of the
                                        order yesterday it’s ready for your
                                        review and acceptance when you have a
                                        moment. Let me know once that’s done so
                                        I can align the next actions
                                        accordingly.

                                            address for submission alerts, your

                                            callbacks (if it differs from the

                                              Ted,
                                              I hear you and I’ve understood
                                              what’s at stake here from the
                                              beginning. This isn’t just about
                                              getting more interviews; it’s
                                              about landing the right role that
                                              brings real stability. That’s the
                                              standard I’m working with, and
                                              that’s exactly what I’m building
                                              this around.
                                              You’ve trusted me to step in at a
                                              critical point, and I don’t take
                                              that lightly. I’m fully committed
                                              to making sure this leads to
                                              something that makes the entire
                                              journey worth it. We’re not here
                                              to play the long game we’re here
                                              to win it. Let’s stay the course.

I completely understand where you’re coming from, and that’s exactly why I’m
suggesting we take a practical step forward. Let’s move ahead with just the
Statement of Purpose and One-Page Career Summary for now. These two will lay the
right foundation for the resume distribution and give recruiters what they need
up front. The “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter can come later, it’s best used as a
follow-up tool once responses start coming in.
This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and doing things
differently so you don’t repeat the same frustrating cycle. I’ve invested
serious time, strategy, and resources into this with you, not because it’s
transactional, but because I see where you should be and I want to get you
there. Let’s act while momentum’s still on our side. Should I proceed with these
two?

    Ted,
    Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building all three. Each of
    these documents serves a very specific purpose, and they’re built from
    tested frameworks that don’t just look good, they read with the clarity and
    precision recruiters want. The Statement of Purpose gives your transition
    and direction context; the One-Page Career Summary captures your profile at
    a glance for executive reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me letter is the
    sharp positioning tool that gives you presence even before the interview.
    Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400 respectively, $1000 in
    total. But considering our work so far and your trust in the process, I’ll
    lock the full package in for $900 flat. You already know this isn’t about
    documents, it’s about traction, and half effort doesn’t produce half
    results. It produces none. Let me know if I should proceed and we’ll lock
    these in right away.

        Ted,
        You have done a great job pulling everything together, and I’m glad we
        now have most of the key pieces in place. However, I noticed we're still
        missing a few critical components: your Statement of Purpose (SOP), a
        One-Page Career Summary, and a “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter. These
        aren’t just nice to have, after several meetings I had with recruiters
        today, they made it clear that for distribution to be taken seriously,
        these supporting pieces are now considered essential.
        They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth, and quickly show
        hiring teams why you're a standout candidate. Let’s get these done to
        position you properly from the start. Are you open to letting me build
        them in to match the rest of the strategy?

                  letter and statement of purpose. These aren’t just supporting
                  documents they’re key in establishing your intent, focus, and

                  Including them ensures we’re not just sending a resume, but
                  delivering a full professional profile that speaks directly to
                  what hiring managers are screening for. Once I have both, I’ll

                    Near as I can tell, from my end both orders have been closed

                      Ted, you should know you’ve been fortunate with timing. I
                      haven’t been this hands-on with other clients lately, but
                      I chose to stay directly involved here because I see the
                      potential and I’m committed to where this is headed.
                      Also, take a moment to check back on Fiverr when you can
                      just to keep everything updated and closed out cleanly on
                      that end. Let’s keep the momentum tight.

                            of a disconnect earlier, but I’m glad we’re now on

                            Go ahead and proceed with creating the Gmail inbox

                                Ted,
                                Let me clarify, this is precisely where my line
                                of work comes in. The reason I didn’t ask for
                                access to your primary Gmail is because I fully
                                respect its sensitivity. What I suggested was
                                creating a dedicated, job-specific email—one
                                managed on your end that I can temporarily
                                access solely for resume distribution purposes.
                                This isn't about reading your personal messages;
                                it’s about directly managing outreach, following
                                up with hiring teams, and keeping the process
                                fast and controlled.
                                That’s the core difference between what I do and
                                the “networking-only” strategies you’ve been
                                exposed to before. Resume distribution, done
                                right, involves active engagement with
                                decision-makers not just uploading your résumé
                                and hoping for a reply. If you'd prefer, you can
                                create a clean inbox specifically for this
                                purpose and send over the credentials. That
                                allows me to deliver what you signed up for
                                efficient, direct positioning. Let me know your
                                thoughts.

                                                ready. To finalize everything
                                                and launch the distribution,
                                                I’ll need a few essentials from
                                                you: an active Gmail address for
                                                submission alerts, your
                                                preferred phone number for
                                                recruiter callbacks (if it
                                                differs from the one on your

                                                roles you’ve manually applied to
                                                since May 25 so we avoid any
                                                overlap. Once I have these,
                                                we’ll proceed directly with the
                                                outreach.

I hear every word, and I need you to understand this clearly: you’re not alone,
and since you came here, your situation is no longer without structure. You’ve
made it to the right place, and I don’t take that lightly. Everything we’re
building now is with one goal: getting you hired into a role that fits your
skill, values, and life. And I’m telling you confidently, we will.
There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s locked in. No
tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both stay committed with a clear focus
and a mindset that refuses to quit, you’re going to get interviews, real ones.
I’m personally aiming for you to have at least 4 interview opportunities this
coming week. I don't make empty promises, I build systems that deliver. And Ted,
your story is not ending here.

I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you thinking about how
we’re going to walk back into that industry with results that even your past
self couldn’t imagine. You’re already inside the process. Nothing worse can
happen to your career from here, only better.
Let’s proceed. Let’s finish this strong.

  I do not know if I told you that I am neurodivergent.   High functioning
  autistic.  That means simultaneously I am very vulnerable to fraud, and I find
  it hard to trust a society that seems designed to make sure that I fail.
  Tell me straight, would even $1000 be enough for your system to work?
   What kind of mafia have I gotten myself into?  I certainly cannot afford to
  throw the equivalent of mortgage payments at this, I have responsibilities.
  7 years ago, recruiters were calling me regularly.  Finding that perfect fit
  was hard, but doable.
  Now you are expecting me to pay just to apply, and will not even send my
  resume to youe network without endless documents.   It is a hard pill to
  swallow.
  Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough life insurance to
  take care of my family for five years and give them a house debt free.  Maybe
  it would be easier just to drive off a cliff.

    I completely understand where you’re coming from, and that’s exactly why I’m
    suggesting we take a practical step forward. Let’s move ahead with just the
    Statement of Purpose and One-Page Career Summary for now. These two will lay
    the right foundation for the resume distribution and give recruiters what
    they need up front. The “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter can come later, it’s
    best used as a follow-up tool once responses start coming in.
    This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and doing things
    differently so you don’t repeat the same frustrating cycle. I’ve invested
    serious time, strategy, and resources into this with you, not because it’s
    transactional, but because I see where you should be and I want to get you
    there. Let’s act while momentum’s still on our side. Should I proceed with
    these two?

        Ted,
        Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building all three. Each
        of these documents serves a very specific purpose, and they’re built
        from tested frameworks that don’t just look good, they read with the
        clarity and precision recruiters want. The Statement of Purpose gives
        your transition and direction context; the One-Page Career Summary
        captures your profile at a glance for executive reviewers; and the Hire
        Me or Steal Me letter is the sharp positioning tool that gives you
        presence even before the interview.
        Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400 respectively, $1000
        in total. But considering our work so far and your trust in the process,
        I’ll lock the full package in for $900 flat. You already know this isn’t
        about documents, it’s about traction, and half effort doesn’t produce
        half results. It produces none. Let me know if I should proceed and
        we’ll lock these in right away.

            You have done a great job pulling everything together, and I’m glad
            we now have most of the key pieces in place. However, I noticed
            we're still missing a few critical components: your Statement of
            Purpose (SOP), a One-Page Career Summary, and a “Hire Me or Steal
            Me” letter. These aren’t just nice to have, after several meetings I
            had with recruiters today, they made it clear that for distribution
            to be taken seriously, these supporting pieces are now considered
            essential.
            They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth, and quickly
            show hiring teams why you're a standout candidate. Let’s get these
            done to position you properly from the start. Are you open to
            letting me build them in to match the rest of the strategy?

                      supporting documents they’re key in establishing your

                      Including them ensures we’re not just sending a resume,
                      but delivering a full professional profile that speaks

                                entire process much more efficient and hands-on,
                                exactly how real distribution should function.
                                Go ahead and proceed with creating the Gmail
                                inbox when you’re able. Once it's ready, we’ll
                                plug it into the workflow and move straight into
                                targeted execution. Let’s keep things moving.

                                  I'll create a clean inbox for that purpose.
                                  I'll need a bit of time to do it, because my

                                    Let me clarify, this is precisely where my
                                    line of work comes in. The reason I didn’t
                                    ask for access to your primary Gmail is
                                    because I fully respect its sensitivity.
                                    What I suggested was creating a dedicated,
                                    job-specific email—one managed on your end
                                    that I can temporarily access solely for
                                    resume distribution purposes. This isn't
                                    about reading your personal messages; it’s
                                    about directly managing outreach, following
                                    up with hiring teams, and keeping the
                                    process fast and controlled.
                                    That’s the core difference between what I do
                                    and the “networking-only” strategies you’ve
                                    been exposed to before. Resume distribution,
                                    done right, involves active engagement with
                                    decision-makers not just uploading your
                                    résumé and hoping for a reply. If you'd
                                    prefer, you can create a clean inbox
                                    specifically for this purpose and send over
                                    the credentials. That allows me to deliver
                                    what you signed up for efficient, direct
                                    positioning. Let me know your thoughts.

    alone, and since you came here, your situation is no longer without
    structure. You’ve made it to the right place, and I don’t take that lightly.
    Everything we’re building now is with one goal: getting you hired into a
    role that fits your skill, values, and life. And I’m telling you
    confidently, we will.
    There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s locked in. No
    tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both stay committed with a clear
    focus and a mindset that refuses to quit, you’re going to get interviews,
    real ones. I’m personally aiming for you to have at least 4 interview
    opportunities this coming week. I don't make empty promises, I build systems
    that deliver. And Ted, your story is not ending here.

    I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you thinking about
    how we’re going to walk back into that industry with results that even your
    past self couldn’t imagine. You’re already inside the process. Nothing worse
    can happen to your career from here, only better.

      My give-a-shit barrel is really low right now.  As is my level of trust.
      Adding more $$$ to this project when I do not even know if I will be able
      to stay out of bankruptcy makes trust harder.
      I do not know if I told you that I am neurodivergent.   High functioning
      autistic.  That means simultaneously I am very vulnerable to fraud, and I
      find it hard to trust a society that seems designed to make sure that I
      fail.
      Tell me straight, would even $1000 be enough for your system to work?
       What kind of mafia have I gotten myself into?  I certainly cannot afford
      to throw the equivalent of mortgage payments at this, I have
      responsibilities.
      7 years ago, recruiters were calling me regularly.  Finding that perfect
      fit was hard, but doable.
      Now you are expecting me to pay just to apply, and will not even send my
      resume to youe network without endless documents.   It is a hard pill to
      swallow.
      Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough life insurance
      to take care of my family for five years and give them a house debt free.
      Maybe it would be easier just to drive off a cliff.

        I completely understand where you’re coming from, and that’s exactly why
        I’m suggesting we take a practical step forward. Let’s move ahead with
        just the Statement of Purpose and One-Page Career Summary for now. These
        two will lay the right foundation for the resume distribution and give
        recruiters what they need up front. The “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter can
        come later, it’s best used as a follow-up tool once responses start
        coming in.
        This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and doing
        things differently so you don’t repeat the same frustrating cycle. I’ve
        invested serious time, strategy, and resources into this with you, not
        because it’s transactional, but because I see where you should be and I
        want to get you there. Let’s act while momentum’s still on our side.
        Should I proceed with these two?

            with the clarity and precision recruiters want. The Statement of
            Purpose gives your transition and direction context; the One-Page
            Career Summary captures your profile at a glance for executive
            reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me letter is the sharp
            positioning tool that gives you presence even before the interview.
            Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400 respectively,
            $1000 in total. But considering our work so far and your trust in
            the process, I’ll lock the full package in for $900 flat. You
            already know this isn’t about documents, it’s about traction, and
            half effort doesn’t produce half results. It produces none. Let me
            know if I should proceed and we’ll lock these in right away.

              Go ahead and build these, as I am unsure of the definition of

                Ted,
                You have done a great job pulling everything together, and I’m
                glad we now have most of the key pieces in place. However, I
                noticed we're still missing a few critical components: your
                Statement of Purpose (SOP), a One-Page Career Summary, and a
                “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter. These aren’t just nice to have,
                after several meetings I had with recruiters today, they made it
                clear that for distribution to be taken seriously, these
                supporting pieces are now considered essential.
                They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth, and
                quickly show hiring teams why you're a standout candidate. Let’s
                get these done to position you properly from the start. Are you
                open to letting me build them in to match the rest of the
                strategy?

                          distribution process, I’ll need you to forward both

                          Including them ensures we’re not just sending a
                          resume, but delivering a full professional profile
                          that speaks directly to what hiring managers are
                          screening for. Once I have both, I’ll incorporate them

                                        Let me clarify, this is precisely where
                                        my line of work comes in. The reason I
                                        didn’t ask for access to your primary
                                        Gmail is because I fully respect its
                                        sensitivity. What I suggested was
                                        creating a dedicated, job-specific
                                        email—one managed on your end that I can
                                        temporarily access solely for resume
                                        distribution purposes. This isn't about
                                        reading your personal messages; it’s
                                        about directly managing outreach,
                                        following up with hiring teams, and
                                        keeping the process fast and controlled.
                                        That’s the core difference between what
                                        I do and the “networking-only”
                                        strategies you’ve been exposed to
                                        before. Resume distribution, done right,
                                        involves active engagement with
                                        decision-makers not just uploading your
                                        résumé and hoping for a reply. If you'd
                                        prefer, you can create a clean inbox
                                        specifically for this purpose and send
                                        over the credentials. That allows me to

                                            cleaner tracking, I’d suggest using
                                            seebert_st@informationr.us just
                                            forward the login details for that
                                            one so we can keep everything
                                            streamlined without needing access
                                            to your official Gmail.
                                            As for the Fiverr rating prompt, try
                                            refreshing the page or checking your
                                            notifications, it should appear once
                                            the system recognizes the delivery.
                                            Let me know once both are sorted so
                                            we can keep this moving.

                                              That will forward automatically to

As the weekend settles in, I just wanted to check in on you and your family. I
hope your wife is continuing to recover smoothly after the surgeries and that
you’re finding a little space to breathe in the middle of it all. I know how
much you’ve been juggling.
On my end, I’m still fully committed to seeing this through with you. Everything
we’ve laid down is setting the stage for something solid, and I remain confident
we’ll break into the right opportunity. Let me know how you’re holding up.

      Ted,
      I hear every word, and I need you to understand this clearly: you’re not
      alone, and since you came here, your situation is no longer without
      structure. You’ve made it to the right place, and I don’t take that
      lightly. Everything we’re building now is with one goal: getting you hired
      into a role that fits your skill, values, and life. And I’m telling you
      confidently, we will.
      There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s locked in.
      No tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both stay committed with a
      clear focus and a mindset that refuses to quit, you’re going to get
      interviews, real ones. I’m personally aiming for you to have at least 4
      interview opportunities this coming week. I don't make empty promises, I
      build systems that deliver. And Ted, your story is not ending here.

      I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you thinking about
      how we’re going to walk back into that industry with results that even
      your past self couldn’t imagine. You’re already inside the process.
      Nothing worse can happen to your career from here, only better.
      Let’s proceed. Let’s finish this strong.

        My give-a-shit barrel is really low right now.  As is my level of
        trust.  Adding more $$$ to this project when I do not even know if I
        will be able to stay out of bankruptcy makes trust harder.
        I do not know if I told you that I am neurodivergent.   High functioning
        autistic.  That means simultaneously I am very vulnerable to fraud, and
        I find it hard to trust a society that seems designed to make sure that
        I fail.
        Tell me straight, would even $1000 be enough for your system to work?
         What kind of mafia have I gotten myself into?  I certainly cannot
        afford to throw the equivalent of mortgage payments at this, I have
        responsibilities.
        7 years ago, recruiters were calling me regularly.  Finding that perfect
        fit was hard, but doable.
        Now you are expecting me to pay just to apply, and will not even send my
        resume to youe network without endless documents.   It is a hard pill to
        swallow.
        Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough life insurance
        to take care of my family for five years and give them a house debt
        free.  Maybe it would be easier just to drive off a cliff.

          I completely understand where you’re coming from, and that’s exactly
          why I’m suggesting we take a practical step forward. Let’s move ahead
          with just the Statement of Purpose and One-Page Career Summary for
          now. These two will lay the right foundation for the resume
          distribution and give recruiters what they need up front. The “Hire Me
          or Steal Me” letter can come later, it’s best used as a follow-up tool
          once responses start coming in.
          This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and doing
          things differently so you don’t repeat the same frustrating cycle.
          I’ve invested serious time, strategy, and resources into this with
          you, not because it’s transactional, but because I see where you
          should be and I want to get you there. Let’s act while momentum’s
          still on our side. Should I proceed with these two?

              Ted,
              Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building all
              three. Each of these documents serves a very specific purpose, and
              they’re built from tested frameworks that don’t just look good,
              they read with the clarity and precision recruiters want. The
              Statement of Purpose gives your transition and direction context;
              the One-Page Career Summary captures your profile at a glance for
              executive reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me letter is the
              sharp positioning tool that gives you presence even before the
              interview.
              Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400 respectively,
              $1000 in total. But considering our work so far and your trust in
              the process, I’ll lock the full package in for $900 flat. You
              already know this isn’t about documents, it’s about traction, and
              half effort doesn’t produce half results. It produces none. Let me
              know if I should proceed and we’ll lock these in right away.

                  You have done a great job pulling everything together, and I’m
                  glad we now have most of the key pieces in place. However, I
                  noticed we're still missing a few critical components: your
                  Statement of Purpose (SOP), a One-Page Career Summary, and a
                  “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter. These aren’t just nice to have,
                  after several meetings I had with recruiters today, they made
                  it clear that for distribution to be taken seriously, these
                  supporting pieces are now considered essential.
                  They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth, and
                  quickly show hiring teams why you're a standout candidate.
                  Let’s get these done to position you properly from the start.
                  Are you open to letting me build them in to match the rest of

                                Also, take a moment to check back on Fiverr when
                                you can just to keep everything updated and
                                closed out cleanly on that end. Let’s keep the
                                momentum tight.

                                  Once the autoforward is in place, I’ll begin
                                  integrating it into the distribution pipeline.
                                  We’re right on track, and I’ll be moving
                                  forward with the next phase shortly.

                                      glad we’re now on the same page. This

                                      more efficient and hands-on, exactly how
                                      real distribution should function.
                                      Go ahead and proceed with creating the
                                      Gmail inbox when you’re able. Once it's

                                          Let me clarify, this is precisely
                                          where my line of work comes in. The
                                          reason I didn’t ask for access to your
                                          primary Gmail is because I fully
                                          respect its sensitivity. What I
                                          suggested was creating a dedicated,
                                          job-specific email—one managed on your
                                          end that I can temporarily access
                                          solely for resume distribution
                                          purposes. This isn't about reading
                                          your personal messages; it’s about
                                          directly managing outreach, following
                                          up with hiring teams, and keeping the
                                          process fast and controlled.
                                          That’s the core difference between
                                          what I do and the “networking-only”
                                          strategies you’ve been exposed to
                                          before. Resume distribution, done
                                          right, involves active engagement with
                                          decision-makers not just uploading
                                          your résumé and hoping for a reply. If
                                          you'd prefer, you can create a clean
                                          inbox specifically for this purpose
                                          and send over the credentials. That
                                          allows me to deliver what you signed
                                          up for efficient, direct positioning.
                                          Let me know your thoughts.

in and moving with focus. Let me know if you're aligned.

        I hear every word, and I need you to understand this clearly: you’re not
        alone, and since you came here, your situation is no longer without
        structure. You’ve made it to the right place, and I don’t take that
        lightly. Everything we’re building now is with one goal: getting you
        hired into a role that fits your skill, values, and life. And I’m
        telling you confidently, we will.
        There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s locked in.
        No tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both stay committed with a
        clear focus and a mindset that refuses to quit, you’re going to get
        interviews, real ones. I’m personally aiming for you to have at least 4
        interview opportunities this coming week. I don't make empty promises, I
        build systems that deliver. And Ted, your story is not ending here.

        I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you thinking
        about how we’re going to walk back into that industry with results that
        even your past self couldn’t imagine. You’re already inside the process.
        Nothing worse can happen to your career from here, only better.
        Let’s proceed. Let’s finish this strong.

          My give-a-shit barrel is really low right now.  As is my level of

          will be able to stay out of bankruptcy makes trust harder.
          I do not know if I told you that I am neurodivergent.   High
          functioning autistic.  That means simultaneously I am very vulnerable
          to fraud, and I find it hard to trust a society that seems designed to
          make sure that I fail.
          Tell me straight, would even $1000 be enough for your system to work?
           What kind of mafia have I gotten myself into?  I certainly cannot
          afford to throw the equivalent of mortgage payments at this, I have
          responsibilities.
          7 years ago, recruiters were calling me regularly.  Finding that
          perfect fit was hard, but doable.
          Now you are expecting me to pay just to apply, and will not even send
          my resume to youe network without endless documents.   It is a hard
          pill to swallow.
          Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough life
          insurance to take care of my family for five years and give them a
          house debt free.  Maybe it would be easier just to drive off a cliff.

            distribution and give recruiters what they need up front. The “Hire
            Me or Steal Me” letter can come later, it’s best used as a follow-up
            tool once responses start coming in.
            This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and doing
            things differently so you don’t repeat the same frustrating cycle.
            I’ve invested serious time, strategy, and resources into this with
            you, not because it’s transactional, but because I see where you
            should be and I want to get you there. Let’s act while momentum’s
            still on our side. Should I proceed with these two?

                Ted,
                Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building all
                three. Each of these documents serves a very specific purpose,
                and they’re built from tested frameworks that don’t just look
                good, they read with the clarity and precision recruiters want.
                The Statement of Purpose gives your transition and direction
                context; the One-Page Career Summary captures your profile at a
                glance for executive reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me
                letter is the sharp positioning tool that gives you presence
                even before the interview.
                Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400 respectively,
                $1000 in total. But considering our work so far and your trust
                in the process, I’ll lock the full package in for $900 flat. You
                already know this isn’t about documents, it’s about traction,
                and half effort doesn’t produce half results. It produces none.
                Let me know if I should proceed and we’ll lock these in right
                away.

                  Go ahead and build these, as I am unsure of the definition of

                    Ted,
                    You have done a great job pulling everything together, and
                    I’m glad we now have most of the key pieces in place.
                    However, I noticed we're still missing a few critical
                    components: your Statement of Purpose (SOP), a One-Page
                    Career Summary, and a “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter. These
                    aren’t just nice to have, after several meetings I had with
                    recruiters today, they made it clear that for distribution
                    to be taken seriously, these supporting pieces are now
                    considered essential.
                    They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth, and
                    quickly show hiring teams why you're a standout candidate.
                    Let’s get these done to position you properly from the
                    start. Are you open to letting me build them in to match the
                    rest of the strategy?

                                            managed on your end that I can
                                            temporarily access solely for resume
                                            distribution purposes. This isn't
                                            about reading your personal
                                            messages; it’s about directly
                                            managing outreach, following up with
                                            hiring teams, and keeping the
                                            process fast and controlled.
                                            That’s the core difference between
                                            what I do and the “networking-only”
                                            strategies you’ve been exposed to
                                            before. Resume distribution, done
                                            right, involves active engagement
                                            with decision-makers not just
                                            uploading your résumé and hoping for
                                            a reply. If you'd prefer, you can
                                            create a clean inbox specifically
                                            for this purpose and send over the
                                            credentials. That allows me to
                                            deliver what you signed up for
                                            efficient, direct positioning. Let
                                            me know your thoughts.

Glad to see things back on track and that local architecture role sounds like a
solid lead. The Statement of Purpose, Executive Career Summary, and Hire
Me/Steal Me letter are all ready and aligned with your direction.
I’ll also include your resume in Word format so you can make quick edits when
needed. Everything’s structured for flexibility and recruiter-facing clarity.
Let’s make it count.

        Ted,
        I hear every word, and I need you to understand this clearly: you’re not
        alone, and since you came here, your situation is no longer without
        structure. You’ve made it to the right place, and I don’t take that
        lightly. Everything we’re building now is with one goal: getting you
        hired into a role that fits your skill, values, and life. And I’m
        telling you confidently, we will.
        There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s locked in.
        No tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both stay committed with a
        clear focus and a mindset that refuses to quit, you’re going to get
        interviews, real ones. I’m personally aiming for you to have at least 4
        interview opportunities this coming week. I don't make empty promises, I
        build systems that deliver. And Ted, your story is not ending here.

        I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you thinking
        about how we’re going to walk back into that industry with results that
        even your past self couldn’t imagine. You’re already inside the process.
        Nothing worse can happen to your career from here, only better.
        Let’s proceed. Let’s finish this strong.

          I do not know if I told you that I am neurodivergent.   High

          7 years ago, recruiters were calling me regularly.  Finding that
          perfect fit was hard, but doable.
          Now you are expecting me to pay just to apply, and will not even send
          my resume to youe network without endless documents.   It is a hard
          pill to swallow.
          Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough life
          insurance to take care of my family for five years and give them a
          house debt free.  Maybe it would be easier just to drive off a cliff.

            I completely understand where you’re coming from, and that’s exactly
            why I’m suggesting we take a practical step forward. Let’s move
            ahead with just the Statement of Purpose and One-Page Career Summary
            for now. These two will lay the right foundation for the resume
            distribution and give recruiters what they need up front. The “Hire
            Me or Steal Me” letter can come later, it’s best used as a follow-up
            tool once responses start coming in.
            This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and doing
            things differently so you don’t repeat the same frustrating cycle.
            I’ve invested serious time, strategy, and resources into this with
            you, not because it’s transactional, but because I see where you
            should be and I want to get you there. Let’s act while momentum’s
            still on our side. Should I proceed with these two?

                Ted,
                Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building all
                three. Each of these documents serves a very specific purpose,
                and they’re built from tested frameworks that don’t just look
                good, they read with the clarity and precision recruiters want.
                The Statement of Purpose gives your transition and direction
                context; the One-Page Career Summary captures your profile at a
                glance for executive reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me
                letter is the sharp positioning tool that gives you presence
                even before the interview.
                Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400 respectively,
                $1000 in total. But considering our work so far and your trust
                in the process, I’ll lock the full package in for $900 flat. You
                already know this isn’t about documents, it’s about traction,
                and half effort doesn’t produce half results. It produces none.
                Let me know if I should proceed and we’ll lock these in right
                away.

                    I’m glad we now have most of the key pieces in place.
                    However, I noticed we're still missing a few critical
                    components: your Statement of Purpose (SOP), a One-Page
                    Career Summary, and a “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter. These
                    aren’t just nice to have, after several meetings I had with
                    recruiters today, they made it clear that for distribution
                    to be taken seriously, these supporting pieces are now
                    considered essential.
                    They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth, and
                    quickly show hiring teams why you're a standout candidate.
                    Let’s get these done to position you properly from the

                                  Ted, you should know you’ve been fortunate
                                  with timing. I haven’t been this hands-on with
                                  other clients lately, but I chose to stay
                                  directly involved here because I see the
                                  potential and I’m committed to where this is
                                  headed.
                                  Also, take a moment to check back on Fiverr
                                  when you can just to keep everything updated
                                  and closed out cleanly on that end. Let’s keep
                                  the momentum tight.

                                    That works perfectly, Ted. Glad to see you
                                    had that flexibility available this setup
                                    gives us exactly what we need to operate
                                    cleanly and with precision.
                                    Once the autoforward is in place, I’ll begin
                                    integrating it into the distribution
                                    pipeline. We’re right on track, and I’ll be
                                    moving forward with the next phase shortly.

                                        Exactly that clears it up. I figured
                                        there was a bit of a disconnect earlier,
                                        but I’m glad we’re now on the same page.
                                        This setup will make the entire process
                                        much more efficient and hands-on,
                                        exactly how real distribution should
                                        function.
                                        Go ahead and proceed with creating the
                                        Gmail inbox when you’re able. Once it's
                                        ready, we’ll plug it into the workflow
                                        and move straight into targeted
                                        execution. Let’s keep things moving.

                                            Let me clarify, this is precisely
                                            where my line of work comes in. The
                                            reason I didn’t ask for access to
                                            your primary Gmail is because I
                                            fully respect its sensitivity. What
                                            I suggested was creating a
                                            dedicated, job-specific email—one
                                            managed on your end that I can
                                            temporarily access solely for resume
                                            distribution purposes. This isn't
                                            about reading your personal
                                            messages; it’s about directly
                                            managing outreach, following up with
                                            hiring teams, and keeping the
                                            process fast and controlled.
                                            That’s the core difference between
                                            what I do and the “networking-only”
                                            strategies you’ve been exposed to
                                            before. Resume distribution, done
                                            right, involves active engagement
                                            with decision-makers not just
                                            uploading your résumé and hoping for
                                            a reply. If you'd prefer, you can
                                            create a clean inbox specifically
                                            for this purpose and send over the
                                            credentials. That allows me to
                                            deliver what you signed up for
                                            efficient, direct positioning. Let
                                            me know your thoughts.

            I hear every word, and I need you to understand this clearly: you’re
            not alone, and since you came here, your situation is no longer
            without structure. You’ve made it to the right place, and I don’t
            take that lightly. Everything we’re building now is with one goal:
            getting you hired into a role that fits your skill, values, and
            life. And I’m telling you confidently, we will.
            There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s locked
            in. No tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both stay committed
            with a clear focus and a mindset that refuses to quit, you’re going
            to get interviews, real ones. I’m personally aiming for you to have
            at least 4 interview opportunities this coming week. I don't make
            empty promises, I build systems that deliver. And Ted, your story is
            not ending here.

            I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you thinking
            about how we’re going to walk back into that industry with results
            that even your past self couldn’t imagine. You’re already inside the
            process. Nothing worse can happen to your career from here, only
            better.

              send my resume to youe network without endless documents.   It is
              a hard pill to swallow.
              Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough life
              insurance to take care of my family for five years and give them a
              house debt free.  Maybe it would be easier just to drive off a
              cliff.

                I completely understand where you’re coming from, and that’s
                exactly why I’m suggesting we take a practical step forward.
                Let’s move ahead with just the Statement of Purpose and One-Page
                Career Summary for now. These two will lay the right foundation
                for the resume distribution and give recruiters what they need
                up front. The “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter can come later, it’s
                best used as a follow-up tool once responses start coming in.
                This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and
                doing things differently so you don’t repeat the same
                frustrating cycle. I’ve invested serious time, strategy, and
                resources into this with you, not because it’s transactional,
                but because I see where you should be and I want to get you
                there. Let’s act while momentum’s still on our side. Should I
                proceed with these two?

                    Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building all
                    three. Each of these documents serves a very specific
                    purpose, and they’re built from tested frameworks that don’t
                    just look good, they read with the clarity and precision
                    recruiters want. The Statement of Purpose gives your
                    transition and direction context; the One-Page Career
                    Summary captures your profile at a glance for executive
                    reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me letter is the sharp
                    positioning tool that gives you presence even before the
                    interview.
                    Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400
                    respectively, $1000 in total. But considering our work so
                    far and your trust in the process, I’ll lock the full
                    package in for $900 flat. You already know this isn’t about
                    documents, it’s about traction, and half effort doesn’t
                    produce half results. It produces none. Let me know if I
                    should proceed and we’ll lock these in right away.

                      Go ahead and build these, as I am unsure of the definition

                      have to fall back on AI and it would look fake.

                        You have done a great job pulling everything together,
                        and I’m glad we now have most of the key pieces in
                        place. However, I noticed we're still missing a few
                        critical components: your Statement of Purpose (SOP), a
                        One-Page Career Summary, and a “Hire Me or Steal Me”
                        letter. These aren’t just nice to have, after several
                        meetings I had with recruiters today, they made it clear
                        that for distribution to be taken seriously, these
                        supporting pieces are now considered essential.
                        They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth,
                        and quickly show hiring teams why you're a standout
                        candidate. Let’s get these done to position you properly
                        from the start. Are you open to letting me build them in
                        to match the rest of the strategy?

                                  throughout the distribution process, I’ll need

                                  statement of purpose. These aren’t just
                                  supporting documents they’re key in

                                  Including them ensures we’re not just sending
                                  a resume, but delivering a full professional
                                  profile that speaks directly to what hiring
                                  managers are screening for. Once I have both,

                                            targeted execution. Let’s keep

                                              I'll create a clean inbox for that

                                                Let me clarify, this is
                                                precisely where my line of work
                                                comes in. The reason I didn’t
                                                ask for access to your primary
                                                Gmail is because I fully respect
                                                its sensitivity. What I
                                                suggested was creating a
                                                dedicated, job-specific
                                                email—one managed on your end
                                                that I can temporarily access
                                                solely for resume distribution
                                                purposes. This isn't about
                                                reading your personal messages;
                                                it’s about directly managing
                                                outreach, following up with
                                                hiring teams, and keeping the
                                                process fast and controlled.
                                                That’s the core difference
                                                between what I do and the
                                                “networking-only” strategies
                                                you’ve been exposed to before.
                                                Resume distribution, done right,
                                                involves active engagement with
                                                decision-makers not just
                                                uploading your résumé and hoping
                                                for a reply. If you'd prefer,
                                                you can create a clean inbox
                                                specifically for this purpose
                                                and send over the credentials.
                                                That allows me to deliver what
                                                you signed up for efficient,

Just checking in, do you want me to handle the tailoring of the documents for
that recruiter, or should I simply provide everything in Word format as-is?
They're all ready in PDF, but I can convert and send them in editable format if
that’s all you need.
Let me know how you'd like to proceed so we can keep this tight and timely.

              Ted,
              I hear every word, and I need you to understand this clearly:
              you’re not alone, and since you came here, your situation is no
              longer without structure. You’ve made it to the right place, and I
              don’t take that lightly. Everything we’re building now is with one
              goal: getting you hired into a role that fits your skill, values,
              and life. And I’m telling you confidently, we will.
              There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s
              locked in. No tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both stay
              committed with a clear focus and a mindset that refuses to quit,
              you’re going to get interviews, real ones. I’m personally aiming
              for you to have at least 4 interview opportunities this coming
              week. I don't make empty promises, I build systems that deliver.
              And Ted, your story is not ending here.

              I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you
              thinking about how we’re going to walk back into that industry
              with results that even your past self couldn’t imagine. You’re
              already inside the process. Nothing worse can happen to your
              career from here, only better.
              Let’s proceed. Let’s finish this strong.

                7 years ago, recruiters were calling me regularly.  Finding that
                perfect fit was hard, but doable.
                Now you are expecting me to pay just to apply, and will not even
                send my resume to youe network without endless documents.   It
                is a hard pill to swallow.
                Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough life
                insurance to take care of my family for five years and give them
                a house debt free.  Maybe it would be easier just to drive off a

                  I completely understand where you’re coming from, and that’s
                  exactly why I’m suggesting we take a practical step forward.
                  Let’s move ahead with just the Statement of Purpose and
                  One-Page Career Summary for now. These two will lay the right
                  foundation for the resume distribution and give recruiters
                  what they need up front. The “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter can
                  come later, it’s best used as a follow-up tool once responses
                  start coming in.
                  This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity, and
                  doing things differently so you don’t repeat the same
                  frustrating cycle. I’ve invested serious time, strategy, and
                  resources into this with you, not because it’s transactional,
                  but because I see where you should be and I want to get you
                  there. Let’s act while momentum’s still on our side. Should I
                  proceed with these two?

                      Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for building
                      all three. Each of these documents serves a very specific
                      purpose, and they’re built from tested frameworks that
                      don’t just look good, they read with the clarity and
                      precision recruiters want. The Statement of Purpose gives
                      your transition and direction context; the One-Page Career
                      Summary captures your profile at a glance for executive
                      reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me letter is the sharp
                      positioning tool that gives you presence even before the
                      interview.
                      Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400
                      respectively, $1000 in total. But considering our work so
                      far and your trust in the process, I’ll lock the full
                      package in for $900 flat. You already know this isn’t
                      about documents, it’s about traction, and half effort
                      doesn’t produce half results. It produces none. Let me
                      know if I should proceed and we’ll lock these in right
                      away.

                          clear that for distribution to be taken seriously,
                          these supporting pieces are now considered essential.
                          They help anchor the resume, give your profile depth,
                          and quickly show hiring teams why you're a standout
                          candidate. Let’s get these done to position you

                                    need you to forward both your cover letter

                                    relevance to each role. They allow us to

                                    that goes beyond your technical skillset.
                                    Including them ensures we’re not just
                                    sending a resume, but delivering a full
                                    professional profile that speaks directly to
                                    what hiring managers are screening for. Once
                                    I have both, I’ll incorporate them

                                                  What I suggested was creating

                  Ted,
                  I hear every word, and I need you to understand this clearly:
                  you’re not alone, and since you came here, your situation is
                  no longer without structure. You’ve made it to the right
                  place, and I don’t take that lightly. Everything we’re
                  building now is with one goal: getting you hired into a role
                  that fits your skill, values, and life. And I’m telling you
                  confidently, we will.
                  There are no added fees beyond the $1000 we discussed. That’s
                  locked in. No tricks. No “gotchas.” Just results. If we both
                  stay committed with a clear focus and a mindset that refuses
                  to quit, you’re going to get interviews, real ones. I’m
                  personally aiming for you to have at least 4 interview
                  opportunities this coming week. I don't make empty promises, I
                  build systems that deliver. And Ted, your story is not ending
                  here.

                  I don’t want you thinking about cliffs or exits, I want you
                  thinking about how we’re going to walk back into that industry
                  with results that even your past self couldn’t imagine. You’re
                  already inside the process. Nothing worse can happen to your
                  career from here, only better.
                  Let’s proceed. Let’s finish this strong.

                    My give-a-shit barrel is really low right now.  As is my

                    not even know if I will be able to stay out of bankruptcy
                    makes trust harder.
                    I do not know if I told you that I am neurodivergent.   High
                    functioning autistic.  That means simultaneously I am very
                    vulnerable to fraud, and I find it hard to trust a society
                    that seems designed to make sure that I fail.
                    Tell me straight, would even $1000 be enough for your system
                    to work?
                     What kind of mafia have I gotten myself into?  I certainly
                    cannot afford to throw the equivalent of mortgage payments
                    at this, I have responsibilities.
                    7 years ago, recruiters were calling me regularly.  Finding
                    that perfect fit was hard, but doable.
                    Now you are expecting me to pay just to apply, and will not
                    even send my resume to youe network without endless
                    documents.   It is a hard pill to swallow.
                    Maybe I should just take the other option.  I have enough
                    life insurance to take care of my family for five years and
                    give them a house debt free.  Maybe it would be easier just
                    to drive off a cliff.

                      I completely understand where you’re coming from, and
                      that’s exactly why I’m suggesting we take a practical step
                      forward. Let’s move ahead with just the Statement of
                      Purpose and One-Page Career Summary for now. These two
                      will lay the right foundation for the resume distribution
                      and give recruiters what they need up front. The “Hire Me
                      or Steal Me” letter can come later, it’s best used as a
                      follow-up tool once responses start coming in.
                      This isn’t about the money, it’s about traction, clarity,
                      and doing things differently so you don’t repeat the same
                      frustrating cycle. I’ve invested serious time, strategy,
                      and resources into this with you, not because it’s
                      transactional, but because I see where you should be and I
                      want to get you there. Let’s act while momentum’s still on
                      our side. Should I proceed with these two?

                          Absolutely, I will take full responsibility for
                          building all three. Each of these documents serves a
                          very specific purpose, and they’re built from tested
                          frameworks that don’t just look good, they read with
                          the clarity and precision recruiters want. The
                          Statement of Purpose gives your transition and
                          direction context; the One-Page Career Summary
                          captures your profile at a glance for executive
                          reviewers; and the Hire Me or Steal Me letter is the
                          sharp positioning tool that gives you presence even
                          before the interview.
                          Normally, these are valued at $380, $220, and $400
                          respectively, $1000 in total. But considering our work
                          so far and your trust in the process, I’ll lock the
                          full package in for $900 flat. You already know this
                          isn’t about documents, it’s about traction, and half
                          effort doesn’t produce half results. It produces none.
                          Let me know if I should proceed and we’ll lock these
                          in right away.

                              missing a few critical components: your Statement
                              of Purpose (SOP), a One-Page Career Summary, and a
                              “Hire Me or Steal Me” letter. These aren’t just
                              nice to have, after several meetings I had with
                              recruiters today, they made it clear that for
                              distribution to be taken seriously, these
                              supporting pieces are now considered essential.
                              They help anchor the resume, give your profile
                              depth, and quickly show hiring teams why you're a
                              standout candidate. Let’s get these done to
                              position you properly from the start. Are you open

                                          It might not have asked for a 2nd

                                            fortunate with timing. I haven’t

                                            directly involved here because I see
                                            the potential and I’m committed to
                                            where this is headed.
                                            Also, take a moment to check back on
                                            Fiverr when you can just to keep

Totally understood, and you’ve made a fair point. Not being able to reapply
funds without confirmation of a refund is absolutely reasonable, especially
given everything you've already committed to this project. I wouldn't expect you
to stretch further without knowing where things stand financially.
That said, in light of the refund delays from Upwork and the need to keep the
work pipeline from freezing up completely, I’ve set up a secure Skrill account
to test a faster, more flexible payment channel. Just a small $50 test run will
help confirm if this works as a viable route not just for you, but for other
clients too.
Here’s the link:

No pressure, if it doesn’t process properly, I’ll return it right away. This is
purely a test, not another financial burden. You're already deep into the
journey, and I’m just looking for a practical way to ensure we keep making
progress without being stalled by platforms.
Let me know your thoughts.

    Hi Ted,
    I completely understand your concern, and I want to be very transparent
    about the current situation on my end.
    Unfortunately, due to the unexpected suspension of my Upwork account, I'm
    unable to access our project history or initiate the refund directly from my
    dashboard, as you've already noticed, the order and contract are no longer
    visible on your side either. This is part of Upwork’s policy when one party
    is flagged or under review.
    That said, I’m not giving up not on your project and not on doing what’s
    right. Since I can’t trigger the refund manually, the only viable
    alternative now is for you to initiate a chargeback or dispute directly with
    Upwork or your bank.
    💳 How to initiate a chargeback through Upwork:
    1. Go to your Upwork transaction history:
    https://www.upwork.com/ab/reports/transaction-history
    2. Search for the payment related to the contract with me.
    3. Click on ""Report a problem"" or ""Dispute a charge"", and explain that the
    freelancer's account is now suspended and a refund could not be processed.
    4. If that doesn’t work or isn’t visible, contact Upwork support directly
    via:
    https://support.upwork.com
    Or email: support@upwork.com
    5. Alternatively, reach out to your credit card provider and request a
    chargeback for services not delivered. Since you paid through a secure
    channel, your provider may reverse the charge if Upwork can't intervene.
    Again, I deeply regret how this played out. I genuinely hoped this
    collaboration would take you to your next big opportunity, and I still
    believe you deserve it. If there's any other way I can assist from outside
    Upwork  whether in forwarding your documents, helping with strategy, or
    consulting, I remain available.
    Thanks again for all the trust you placed in me.
    Warm regards

      Hmm...we're stuck then.  I see nothing wrong from my side on Upwork- my
      account has no indication that your account is suspended, and I can no
      longer see the orders at all.
      I also don't have the credit to double pay, regardless of method of
      payment

        Hi Ted,
        I just attempted to process the refund from my end, but it failed. The
        message from Upwork says: “Refund failed, the user is suspended.”
        That means your account is currently restricted on their side, so
        they’re not accepting incoming actions like refunds. I recommend you
        check your Upwork account status or reach out to their support directly.
        You might be able to initiate or request the refund from your side.
        Let me know how it goes — we’re still in this together.

            I truly appreciate the trust you’ve placed in me throughout this
            journey, especially with your recent $150 contribution. That payment
            was securely processed and has been pivotal in pushing the project
            forward to where we are now.
            However, I wanted to clarify something that’s been unfolding behind
            the scenes. As I mentioned earlier, my bank account linked to Upwork
            has been problematic, not only was I unable to receive payouts
            properly, but this also triggered issues with any credit card or
            banking method I connected. The platform flagged unusual activity,
            especially after the bonus of $12,000 on a $280 contract, which
            appeared disproportionate and raised compliance concerns on their
            side.
            As a result, Upwork restricted my account. I’ve been working hard to
            keep your project running using other available resources, actually
            covering parts of the work with trusted team members’ funds because
            of the confidence I have in the value we’re creating for you. But
            now those resources need to be settled, and I wanted to be upfront
            with you.
            That brings me to this: I can initiate a refund of the last $1450
            directly into your Upwork balance if you’d prefer to use a fresh
            account or redirect the funds differently. The money won’t be lost,
            it’ll remain accessible to you.
            Let me know your thoughts. I'm fully committed to your success, but
            I believe mutual clarity and trust are what keep things strong.
            Whatever route you choose, I’ll align accordingly.

                some people are to vanish after collecting payment. That’s not
                our playbook. We don’t ghost clients; we build with them,
                knowing full well this process isn’t magic it’s method.
                Resume distribution, network triggers, recruiter outreach, it’s
                all a pipeline, not a lottery ticket. And the fact that your
                profile is catching recruiter signals already tells me one
                thing: the system is moving, even if the offers haven’t landed
                yet.
                We’ll keep pressing, because unlike the rest, we didn’t start

                  2.  You're trying.  I may be a pessimistic old cynic, but the
                  positive thing about pessimism is, I'll either be proved wrong
                  and the world is a better place than I imagine, or I'll have
                  the satisfaction of being proved right.

                  Having said that, no, from what I can see, I'm getting an
                  equal mix of ""Intel blue badge people with now green flags on
                  their profile picture"" and recruiters.

                  I have had quite a few people use the same cold opening on me
                  as you did to bring me in.  I think 75% of them would just
                  take money, rewrite a resume, and drop me, so thank you for
                  NOT doing that.  When I said I was tapped out, I meant it- I'm
                  being quite harsh with such people, and it seems to be
                  increasing my engagement network.

                  There will be a payoff from my first paycheck for you if you
                  get me an opportunity.

                    Hi Ted,
                    What you’re seeing is the quiet part of the wave progress
                    unfolding behind the scenes. Engagement spikes like this
                    aren’t accidental; they’re signals. Unopened doors don’t
                    mean closed ones just ones not yet knocked hard enough.
                    We’re making noise in the right places, and the market is
                    noticing.
                    Trust the rhythm, we’re just warming up. Let’s see what this
                    momentum turns into over the next few days.
                    By the way, have you noticed any patterns in the recruiters
                    viewing your profile or reaching out, even if just
                    indirectly?

                        It’s been a moment, just looping back in as distribution
                        has been progressing steadily on my side. I wanted to
                        check how things are shaping up on your end. Any
                        movement, callbacks, or just more silence from the other
                        side of the table?
                        I know this game isn’t always loud at first, but with
                        the kind of strategic materials we’ve built, silence
                        usually doesn’t last long unless it’s regrouping before
                        it fires.
                        Let me know where things stand, even if it’s “nothing
                        yet.” That helps us recalibrate if needed. We’ve come
                        this far; the rest is just precision and timing.

                          night’s Knights gathering was a meaningful one. I’m
                          fully geared up for the resume distribution phase now,
                          and yes, I absolutely believe we can break through
                          that old 1:75 wall.
                          We’re not sending out generic applications into the
                          void. This strategy is focused, targeted, and built
                          around positioning not just submitting. It’s about
                          creating traction, not noise. I’ll keep you looped in
                          step-by-step so you can see exactly where things are
                          headed.

                                            places an automatic hold on our

                                            and delays your process entirely.
                                            PayPal doesn’t joke with this. We
                                            avoid these limitations for a reason
                                            results require clean, uninterrupted

                                            it’s on me to deliver. I won’t say
                                            more. But I will let the outcome
                                            speak.
                                            Once payment is sent, send the
                                            screenshot or proof of payment right

                                                Reading your message, I can feel
                                                how much you've been carrying
                                                not just financially, but
                                                emotionally. And I want to say
                                                this clearly: this isn’t just
                                                about a payment. This is about
                                                someone who’s still showing up,
                                                even when it feels like life
                                                keeps testing him from every
                                                angle.
                                                You’ve been honest. You’ve been
                                                present. And even when
                                                frustration crept in, you didn’t
                                                walk away you just wanted to
                                                feel like something was finally
                                                working in your favor. That’s
                                                something I respect deeply.
                                                Working with someone outside the
                                                U.S. isn’t the problem you’ve
                                                done it before. In fact, you’ve
                                                worked with people inside the
                                                U.S. and still ended up pouring
                                                nearly $8,000 into the wrong
                                                hands. So let’s call this what
                                                it really is: not a boundary
                                                issue, but a trust issue built
                                                from too many past letdowns.
                                                I’m not here to take from you
                                                I’m here to deliver you out of
                                                that cycle. Out of the burnout,
                                                the doubt, the weight of feeling
                                                like the return never shows up.
                                                That’s why I’ve arranged for one
                                                of my trusted U.S.-based clients
                                                to help us handle the PayPal

                                                loopholes, just a clean way to
                                                keep moving.
                                                You’ve done your part. Let’s not
                                                let the past define how this
                                                ends. Let’s make this moment
                                                count for real. 💝

Thanks for the heads-up regarding the new regulations, I completely understand
how complex and frustrating things are getting on your side. Let’s set the
Skrill option aside for now and focus on the necessary steps forward.
At this point, it might be best to proceed with initiating the chargeback
through Upwork, as that would allow you to regain your funds securely and
without any further back-and-forth. Once that’s sorted, we can re-strategize
based on your comfort and availability.
Let me know once you’ve taken that step or if you’d prefer I walk you through
the process.

  New laws have gone into effect for services such as Skrill.  I need to submit

    Hi Ted,
    Totally understood, and you’ve made a fair point. Not being able to reapply
    funds without confirmation of a refund is absolutely reasonable, especially
    given everything you've already committed to this project. I wouldn't expect
    you to stretch further without knowing where things stand financially.
    That said, in light of the refund delays from Upwork and the need to keep
    the work pipeline from freezing up completely, I’ve set up a secure Skrill
    account to test a faster, more flexible payment channel. Just a small $50
    test run will help confirm if this works as a viable route not just for you,
    but for other clients too.
    Here’s the link:
    👉 https://skrill.me/rq/MOSES%20OGBU/50/USD?key=wCEBcNXK-f9zRI0uWXZrmz0vOm3
    No pressure, if it doesn’t process properly, I’ll return it right away. This
    is purely a test, not another financial burden. You're already deep into the
    journey, and I’m just looking for a practical way to ensure we keep making
    progress without being stalled by platforms.
    Let me know your thoughts.

        Hi Ted,
        I completely understand your concern, and I want to be very transparent
        about the current situation on my end.
        Unfortunately, due to the unexpected suspension of my Upwork account,
        I'm unable to access our project history or initiate the refund directly
        from my dashboard, as you've already noticed, the order and contract are
        no longer visible on your side either. This is part of Upwork’s policy
        when one party is flagged or under review.
        That said, I’m not giving up not on your project and not on doing what’s
        right. Since I can’t trigger the refund manually, the only viable
        alternative now is for you to initiate a chargeback or dispute directly
        with Upwork or your bank.
        💳 How to initiate a chargeback through Upwork:
        1. Go to your Upwork transaction history:
        https://www.upwork.com/ab/reports/transaction-history
        2. Search for the payment related to the contract with me.
        3. Click on ""Report a problem"" or ""Dispute a charge"", and explain that
        the freelancer's account is now suspended and a refund could not be
        processed.
        4. If that doesn’t work or isn’t visible, contact Upwork support
        directly via:
        https://support.upwork.com
        Or email: support@upwork.com
        5. Alternatively, reach out to your credit card provider and request a
        chargeback for services not delivered. Since you paid through a secure
        channel, your provider may reverse the charge if Upwork can't intervene.
        Again, I deeply regret how this played out. I genuinely hoped this
        collaboration would take you to your next big opportunity, and I still
        believe you deserve it. If there's any other way I can assist from
        outside Upwork  whether in forwarding your documents, helping with
        strategy, or consulting, I remain available.
        Thanks again for all the trust you placed in me.
        Warm regards

          I also don't have the credit to double pay, regardless of method of

            Hi Ted,
            I just attempted to process the refund from my end, but it failed.
            The message from Upwork says: “Refund failed, the user is
            suspended.”
            That means your account is currently restricted on their side, so
            they’re not accepting incoming actions like refunds. I recommend you
            check your Upwork account status or reach out to their support
            directly. You might be able to initiate or request the refund from
            your side.
            Let me know how it goes — we’re still in this together.

                I truly appreciate the trust you’ve placed in me throughout this
                journey, especially with your recent $150 contribution. That
                payment was securely processed and has been pivotal in pushing
                the project forward to where we are now.
                However, I wanted to clarify something that’s been unfolding
                behind the scenes. As I mentioned earlier, my bank account
                linked to Upwork has been problematic, not only was I unable to
                receive payouts properly, but this also triggered issues with
                any credit card or banking method I connected. The platform
                flagged unusual activity, especially after the bonus of $12,000
                on a $280 contract, which appeared disproportionate and raised
                compliance concerns on their side.
                As a result, Upwork restricted my account. I’ve been working
                hard to keep your project running using other available
                resources, actually covering parts of the work with trusted team
                members’ funds because of the confidence I have in the value
                we’re creating for you. But now those resources need to be
                settled, and I wanted to be upfront with you.
                That brings me to this: I can initiate a refund of the last
                $1450 directly into your Upwork balance if you’d prefer to use a
                fresh account or redirect the funds differently. The money won’t
                be lost, it’ll remain accessible to you.
                Let me know your thoughts. I'm fully committed to your success,
                but I believe mutual clarity and trust are what keep things
                strong. Whatever route you choose, I’ll align accordingly.

                    That’s not our playbook. We don’t ghost clients; we build

                    Resume distribution, network triggers, recruiter outreach,
                    it’s all a pipeline, not a lottery ticket. And the fact that

                    one thing: the system is moving, even if the offers haven’t

                    We’ll keep pressing, because unlike the rest, we didn’t

                      I have had quite a few people use the same cold opening on

                      just take money, rewrite a resume, and drop me, so thank

                      meant it- I'm being quite harsh with such people, and it
                      seems to be increasing my engagement network.

                                    Just finished shaping the Value Proposition
                                    Letter to align tightly with your strengths,
                                    tone, and real-world impact. It’s built to
                                    speak directly to hiring managers clear,
                                    confident, and focused on the value you
                                    bring from day one.

                                    We’re already moving in the right direction,
                                    and this piece adds even more clarity to the
                                    message we’ve been crafting. Take a look,
                                    and let me know if you'd like to make any
                                    refinements but as it stands, it’s ready to
                                    start turning attention into traction.

                                      And absolutely noted on Nike, no

                                      later. That boundary is locked in, and
                                      I’ll ensure we stay focused only on

Subject: Request for Chargeback – Suspended Upwork Account / No Service
Completion
Hello,
I’m requesting a chargeback for a recent transaction made via my card to Upwork.
The transaction was for services provided by a freelancer whose account has
since been suspended. Communication has halted, and I am no longer receiving the
agreed services.
I’ve attempted multiple times to get updates or refunds, but nothing has been
resolved. I believe this situation meets the criteria for a chargeback under
“services not rendered” or “suspicious vendor activity.”
Please initiate the chargeback as soon as possible. I can provide screenshots of
the project, messages, and timeline of events if needed.
Thank you,
Theodore Seeber

    Hi Ted,
    Thanks for the heads-up regarding the new regulations, I completely
    understand how complex and frustrating things are getting on your side.
    Let’s set the Skrill option aside for now and focus on the necessary steps
    forward.
    At this point, it might be best to proceed with initiating the chargeback
    through Upwork, as that would allow you to regain your funds securely and
    without any further back-and-forth. Once that’s sorted, we can re-strategize
    based on your comfort and availability.
    Let me know once you’ve taken that step or if you’d prefer I walk you
    through the process.

      New laws have gone into effect for services such as Skrill.  I need to

        Hi Ted,
        Totally understood, and you’ve made a fair point. Not being able to
        reapply funds without confirmation of a refund is absolutely reasonable,
        especially given everything you've already committed to this project. I
        wouldn't expect you to stretch further without knowing where things
        stand financially.
        That said, in light of the refund delays from Upwork and the need to
        keep the work pipeline from freezing up completely, I’ve set up a secure
        Skrill account to test a faster, more flexible payment channel. Just a
        small $50 test run will help confirm if this works as a viable route not
        just for you, but for other clients too.
        Here’s the link:
        👉
        https://skrill.me/rq/MOSES%20OGBU/50/USD?key=wCEBcNXK-f9zRI0uWXZrmz0vOm3
        No pressure, if it doesn’t process properly, I’ll return it right away.
        This is purely a test, not another financial burden. You're already deep
        into the journey, and I’m just looking for a practical way to ensure we
        keep making progress without being stalled by platforms.
        Let me know your thoughts.

            Hi Ted,
            I completely understand your concern, and I want to be very
            transparent about the current situation on my end.
            Unfortunately, due to the unexpected suspension of my Upwork
            account, I'm unable to access our project history or initiate the
            refund directly from my dashboard, as you've already noticed, the
            order and contract are no longer visible on your side either. This
            is part of Upwork’s policy when one party is flagged or under
            review.
            That said, I’m not giving up not on your project and not on doing
            what’s right. Since I can’t trigger the refund manually, the only
            viable alternative now is for you to initiate a chargeback or
            dispute directly with Upwork or your bank.
            💳 How to initiate a chargeback through Upwork:
            1. Go to your Upwork transaction history:
            https://www.upwork.com/ab/reports/transaction-history
            2. Search for the payment related to the contract with me.
            3. Click on ""Report a problem"" or ""Dispute a charge"", and explain
            that the freelancer's account is now suspended and a refund could
            not be processed.
            4. If that doesn’t work or isn’t visible, contact Upwork support
            directly via:
            https://support.upwork.com
            Or email: support@upwork.com
            5. Alternatively, reach out to your credit card provider and request
            a chargeback for services not delivered. Since you paid through a
            secure channel, your provider may reverse the charge if Upwork can't
            intervene.
            Again, I deeply regret how this played out. I genuinely hoped this
            collaboration would take you to your next big opportunity, and I
            still believe you deserve it. If there's any other way I can assist
            from outside Upwork  whether in forwarding your documents, helping
            with strategy, or consulting, I remain available.
            Thanks again for all the trust you placed in me.
            Warm regards

                Hi Ted,
                I just attempted to process the refund from my end, but it
                failed. The message from Upwork says: “Refund failed, the user
                is suspended.”
                That means your account is currently restricted on their side,
                so they’re not accepting incoming actions like refunds. I
                recommend you check your Upwork account status or reach out to
                their support directly. You might be able to initiate or request
                the refund from your side.
                Let me know how it goes — we’re still in this together.

                    I truly appreciate the trust you’ve placed in me throughout
                    this journey, especially with your recent $150 contribution.
                    That payment was securely processed and has been pivotal in
                    pushing the project forward to where we are now.
                    However, I wanted to clarify something that’s been unfolding
                    behind the scenes. As I mentioned earlier, my bank account
                    linked to Upwork has been problematic, not only was I unable
                    to receive payouts properly, but this also triggered issues
                    with any credit card or banking method I connected. The
                    platform flagged unusual activity, especially after the
                    bonus of $12,000 on a $280 contract, which appeared
                    disproportionate and raised compliance concerns on their
                    side.
                    As a result, Upwork restricted my account. I’ve been working
                    hard to keep your project running using other available
                    resources, actually covering parts of the work with trusted
                    team members’ funds because of the confidence I have in the
                    value we’re creating for you. But now those resources need
                    to be settled, and I wanted to be upfront with you.
                    That brings me to this: I can initiate a refund of the last
                    $1450 directly into your Upwork balance if you’d prefer to
                    use a fresh account or redirect the funds differently. The
                    money won’t be lost, it’ll remain accessible to you.
                    Let me know your thoughts. I'm fully committed to your
                    success, but I believe mutual clarity and trust are what
                    keep things strong. Whatever route you choose, I’ll align
                    accordingly.

                        how quick some people are to vanish after collecting
                        payment. That’s not our playbook. We don’t ghost
                        clients; we build with them, knowing full well this
                        process isn’t magic it’s method.
                        Resume distribution, network triggers, recruiter
                        outreach, it’s all a pipeline, not a lottery ticket. And
                        the fact that your profile is catching recruiter signals
                        already tells me one thing: the system is moving, even
                        if the offers haven’t landed yet.
                        We’ll keep pressing, because unlike the rest, we didn’t
                        start this to quit halfway.

                          2.  You're trying.  I may be a pessimistic old cynic,
                          but the positive thing about pessimism is, I'll either
                          be proved wrong and the world is a better place than I
                          imagine, or I'll have the satisfaction of being proved
                          right.

                          Having said that, no, from what I can see, I'm getting
                          an equal mix of ""Intel blue badge people with now
                          green flags on their profile picture"" and recruiters.

                          I have had quite a few people use the same cold
                          opening on me as you did to bring me in.  I think 75%
                          of them would just take money, rewrite a resume, and
                          drop me, so thank you for NOT doing that.  When I said
                          I was tapped out, I meant it- I'm being quite harsh
                          with such people, and it seems to be increasing my
                          engagement network.

                          There will be a payoff from my first paycheck for you
                          if you get me an opportunity.

                            Trust the rhythm, we’re just warming up. Let’s see
                            what this momentum turns into over the next few

                            By the way, have you noticed any patterns in the
                            recruiters viewing your profile or reaching out,

                                distribution has been progressing steadily on my

                                more silence from the other side of the table?
                                I know this game isn’t always loud at first, but
                                with the kind of strategic materials we’ve
                                built, silence usually doesn’t last long unless
                                it’s regrouping before it fires.
                                Let me know where things stand, even if it’s
                                “nothing yet.” That helps us recalibrate if

                                                not just another client here.
                                                This is personal, and I’m
                                                treating it as such. You’re

                                                with precision, not promises. I

                                                        to say this clearly:

                                                        You’ve been honest.
