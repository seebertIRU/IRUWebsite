Once again, This Message is being sent by Theodore Michael Seeber on behalf of Shannon Lynn Seeber.  At or about 10:30pm on December 1, 2022 Shannon had another seizure.  It woke me up, she was unresponsive for about 10 minutes.  I didn't know where her purse and her emergency meds were, but when she came too and started talking about 10:40 pm, I made the decision not to wake her up to go to the emergency room.
 
I then noticed she had an accident in the bed, and we had to wake her up and change the sheets anyway.  We got back to sleep about 11pm, and there were no further incidents.cratch Pad
